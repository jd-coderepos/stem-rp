Condition monitoring using temperature sensitive electrical parameters (TSEPs) is widely recognized as an enabler for health management of power modules. The on-state resistance/forward voltage of MOSFETs, IGBTs and diodes has already been identified as TSEPs by several researchers. However, for SiC MOSFETs, the temperature sensitivity of on-state voltage/resistance varies depending on the device and is generally not as high as in silicon devices. Recently the turn-on current switching rate has been identified as a TSEP in SiC MOSFETs, but its temperature sensitivity was shown to be significantly affected by the gate resistance. Hence, an important consideration regarding the use of TSEPs for health monitoring is how the gate driver can be used for improving the temperature sensitivity of determined electrical parameters and implementing more effective condition monitoring strategies. This paper characterizes the impact of the gate driver voltage on the temperature sensitivity of the on-state resistance and current switching rate of SiC power MOSFETs. It is shown that the temperature sensitivity of the switching rate in SiC MOSFETs increases if the devices are driven at lower gate voltages. It is also shown, that depending on the SiC MOSFET technology, reducing the gate drive voltage can increase the temperature sensitivity of the on-state resistance. Hence, using an intelligent gate driver with the capability of customizing occasional switching pulses for junction temperature sensing using TSEPs, it would be possible to implement condition monitoring more effectively for SiC power devices.
