This paper attempts to design a three-echelon supply chain network for mine industry considering suppliers, manufacturing centers and distributors with different kinds of vehicles. A multi-objective mixed integer programming model is proposed to minimize transportation costs, shortage costs, purchase costs, production costs and CO2 emissions of vehicles with fuzzy demand values. Îµ-constraint method is used in order to convert multiple objective functions to a single objective function. Benders decomposition algorithm is applied to solve the model under three demand-based scenarios. A case study is done on Iranian mine industry to present the significance and applicability of the proposed model in a real-life case problem as well as the efficiency of Benders decomposition.
