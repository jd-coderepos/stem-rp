Although white matter hyperintensities evolve in the course of ageing, few solutions exist to consider the lesion segmentation problem longitudinally. Based on an existing automatic lesion segmentation algorithm, a longitudinal extension is proposed. For evaluation purposes, a longitudinal lesion simulator is created allowing for the comparison between the longitudinal and the cross-sectional version in various situations of lesion load progression. Finally, applied to clinical data, the proposed framework demonstrates an increased robustness compared to available cross-sectional methods and findings are aligned with previously reported clinical patterns.
