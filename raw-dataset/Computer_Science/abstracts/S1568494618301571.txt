The ultimate goal of learning algorithms is to find the best solution from a search space without testing each and every solution available in the search space. During the evolution process new solutions (children) are produced from existing solutions (parents), where new solutions are expected to be better than existing solutions. This paper presents a new parent selection method for the crossover operation in genetic programming. The idea is to promote crossover between two behaviourally (phenotype) diverse parents such that the probability of children being better than their parents increases. The relative phenotype strengths and weaknesses of pairs of parents are exploited to find out if their crossover is beneficial or not (diverse partner selection (DPS)). Based on the probable improvement in children compared to their parents, crossover is either allowed or disallowed. The parents qualifying for crossover through this process are expected to produce much better children and are allowed to produce more children than normal parents through brood recombination (BR). BR helps to explore the search space around diverse parents much more efficiently. Experimental results from different benchmarking problems demonstrate that the proposed method (DPS with BR) improves the performance of genetic programming significantly.
