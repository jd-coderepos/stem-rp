In this paper we study the d -dimensional assignment problem in which entries of the cost array satisfy the Monge property, except for ∞ -entries, which may violate it. We assume that the ∞ -entries are incurred by incompatible partner indices and their number is bounded by an upper bound λ for each index. We show that the problem can be solved in linear time for fixed d and λ , and it becomes strongly NP-hard if d or λ is part of the input.
