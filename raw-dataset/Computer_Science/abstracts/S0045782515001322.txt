In this paper, we perform a comparative analysis between two computational methods for virtual stent deployment: a novel fast virtual stenting method, which is based on a springâ€“mass model, is compared with detailed finite element analysis in a sequence of in silico experiments. Given the results of the initial comparison, we present a way to optimise the fast method by calibrating a set of parameters with the help of a genetic algorithm, which utilises the outcomes of the finite element analysis as a learning reference. As a result of the calibration phase, we were able to substantially reduce the force measure discrepancy between the two methods and validate the fast stenting method by assessing the differences in the final device configurations.
