In this note we consider the concept of alphabet ordering in the context of string factoring. We propose a greedy algorithm that produces Lyndon factorizations with small numbers of factors which can be modified to produce large numbers of factors. For the technique we introduce the Exponent Parikh vector. Applications and research directions derived from circ-UMFFs are discussed.
