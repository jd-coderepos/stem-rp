Increasingly realistic virtual three dimensional (3D) models have been created that demonstrate a variety of landscape designs. They have supported a more collaborative and participative approach in planning and design. However, these 3D landscape models are often developed for use in bespoke virtual reality labs that tie the models to expensive graphics hardware, or complex arrays of screens, with the viewer spatially detached from the actual site. Given the increase in prevalence of advanced “smartphone” and tablet technology with GPS and compass functionality, this paper demonstrates two methods for on-demand dissemination of existing virtual 3D landscape models using: (1) a touch based interface with integrated mapping; (2) a standard web browser interface on mobile phones. The latter method demonstrates the potential to reduce the complexity of accessing an existing 3D landscape model on-site to simply pointing a smartphone in a particular direction, loading a web page and seeing the relevant view of the model as an image. A prototype system was developed to demonstrate both methods successfully, but it was also ascertained that the accuracy of GPS positional data can have a negative effect on the browser based method. Finally, potential developments are presented exploring the future of the technology underpinning the method and possible extensions to the prototype as a technique for increasing public participation in planning and design.
