The main goal of the paper is the modeling of the mechanical circuit breaker (MCB) that can replicate the breaker characteristics in real time environment. The proposed MCB with active current injection is modelled for a system level, which provides adequate representation of the circuit breakers for system analysis studies. External current-voltage characteristics of the proposed MCB models replicate the ones of the devices in the real world. It is well known that the DC circuit breaker (DCCB) needs to interrupt DC faults very quickly in order to avoid converter damages. The total current interruption time consists of fault detection time, time needed for the DC protection to provide command to the DCCB, and DCCB arc clearing time. Thus, it is necessary to demonstrate the system performance of associated protective devices through real time simulation, before these devices can be implemented and commissioned in practice. This paper presents a detailed modeling of the mechanical DCCB in real time simulation environment based on RTDS. The performance of the model is verified by the simulations based on PSCAD and meaningful conclusions are drawn.
