We propose a method of virtual draping by representing the actual draping process, i.e., a pattern is made a from cloth model by mapping. Additionally, the garment form is simulated from the obtained pattern. The process of making the pattern is as follows. A rectangular planar cloth model is made and slit for dart as needed. The slit cloth model is mapped to the surface of a dummy model. The shape of the cloth model under the condition of relaxation on the surface of the dummy model is obtained by mechanical calculation. A three-dimensional pattern shape is obtained to remove unnecessary part of the cloth model. Finally, a planar pattern shape is made by mapping the three-dimensional pattern inversely to a plane. A garment form is also simulated from the obtained pattern. The pattern for a pencil skirt can be made employing the proposed method. We make an actual pencil skirt and simulate its form using this pattern. Thus, the deformation of a cloth and the attaching process can be considered. The present study maps the cloth model to the dummy model to make the garment form and thus represents draping more closely.
