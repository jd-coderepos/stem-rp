The General Single-Dish Data format (GSDD) was developed in the mid-1980s as a data model to support centimeter, millimeter and submillimeter instrumentation at NRAO, JCMT, the University of Arizona and IRAM. We provide an overview of the GSDD requirements and associated data model, discuss the implementation of the resultant file formats, describe its usage in the observatories and provide a retrospective on the format.
