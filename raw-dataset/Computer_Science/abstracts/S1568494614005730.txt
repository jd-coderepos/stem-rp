Thermal errors can have significant effects on CNC machine tool accuracy. The errors come from thermal deformations of the machine elements caused by heat sources within the machine structure or from ambient temperature change. The effect of temperature can be reduced by error avoidance or numerical compensation. The performance of a thermal error compensation system essentially depends upon the accuracy and robustness of the thermal error model and its input measurements. This paper first reviews different methods of designing thermal error models, before concentrating on employing an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to design two thermal prediction models: ANFIS by dividing the data space into rectangular sub-spaces (ANFIS-Grid model) and ANFIS by using the fuzzy c-means clustering method (ANFIS-FCM model). Grey system theory is used to obtain the influence ranking of all possible temperature sensors on the thermal response of the machine structure. All the influence weightings of the thermal sensors are clustered into groups using the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering method, the groups then being further reduced by correlation analysis. A study of a small CNC milling machine is used to provide training data for the proposed models and then to provide independent testing data sets. The results of the study show that the ANFIS-FCM model is superior in terms of the accuracy of its predictive ability with the benefit of fewer rules. The residual value of the proposed model is smaller than ±4μm. This combined methodology can provide improved accuracy and robustness of a thermal error compensation system.
