With the broad adoption of service-oriented architecture, many software systems have been developed by composing loosely-coupled Web services. Service discovery, a critical step of building service-based systems (SBSs), aims to find a set of candidate services for each functional task to be performed by an SBS. The keyword-based search technology adopted by existing service registries is insufficient to retrieve semantically similar services for queries. Although many semantics-aware service discovery approaches have been proposed, they are hard to apply in practice due to the difficulties in ontology construction and semantic annotation. This paper aims to help service requesters (e.g., SBS designers) obtain relevant services accurately with a keyword query by exploiting domain knowledge about service functionalities (i.e., service goals) mined from textual descriptions of services. We firstly extract service goals from servicesâ€™ textual descriptions using an NLP-based method and cluster service goals by measuring their semantic similarities. A query expansion approach is then proposed to help service requesters refine initial queries by recommending similar service goals. Finally, we develop a hybrid service discovery approach by integrating goal-based matching with two practical approaches: keyword-based and topic model-based. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset show the effectiveness of our approach.
