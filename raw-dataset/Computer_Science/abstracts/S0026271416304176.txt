Total Ionizing Dose and Random Dopant Fluctuation simulations in 45nm Partially Depleted Silicon-on-Insulator nMOSFETs are presented. Calibration is done according to the commercial IBM 45nm technology node. The importance of the bottom corner parasitic transistor to the Total Ionizing Dose response is shown with the use of ultra shallow junctions. Simulation of irradiation in two-dimensional slices of the device reveal that the majority of the charge is trapped around the silicon film and at the bottom of the Buried OXide in the case of a positive gate bias. Random Dopant Fluctuations are examined using the Sano and the Impedance Field Method. The simulation results of the two methods are in good agreement. Dopant fluctuations do not produce significant response variation pre-irradiation, but they affect post-irradiation results introducing statistical deviations and aggravating Total Ionizing Dose effects. This effect is more pronounced during weak inversion of the parasitic transistor.
