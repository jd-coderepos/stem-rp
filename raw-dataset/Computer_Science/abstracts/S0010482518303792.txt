Non-invasive analysis of atrial fibrillation (AF) using body surface mapping (BSM) has gained significant interest, with attempts at interpreting atrial spectro-temporal parameters from body surface signals. As these body surface signals could be affected by properties of the torso volume conductor, this interpretation is not always straightforward. This paper highlights the volume conductor effects and influences of the algorithm parameters for identifying the dominant frequency (DF) from cardiac signals collected simultaneously on the torso and atrial surface. Bi-atrial virtual electrograms (VEGMs) and BSMs were recorded simultaneously for 5 min from 10 patients undergoing ablation for persistent AF. Frequency analysis was performed on 4 s segments. DF was defined as the frequency with highest power between 4 and 10 Hz with and without applying organization index (OI) thresholds. The volume conductor effect was assessed by analyzing the highest DF (HDF) difference of each VEGM HDF against its BSM counterpart. Significant differences in HDF values between intra-cardiac and torso signals could be observed, independent of OI threshold. This difference increases with increasing endocardial HDF (BSM-VEGM median difference from −0.13 Hz for VEGM HDF at 6.25 ± 0.25 Hz to −4.24 Hz at 9.75 ± 0.25 Hz), thereby confirming the theory of the volume conductor effect in real-life situations. Applying an OI threshold strongly affected the BSM HDF area size and location and atrial HDF area location. These results suggest that volume conductor and measurement algorithm effects must be considered for appropriate clinical interpretation.
