Recently, a promising trend has evolved from previous centralized computation to decentralized edge computing in the proximity of end-users to provide cloud applications. To ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) of such applications and Quality of Experience (QoE) for the end-users, it is necessary to employ a comprehensive monitoring approach. Requirement analysis is a key software engineering task in the whole lifecycle of applications; however, the requirements for monitoring systems within edge computing scenarios are not yet fully established. The goal of the present survey study is therefore threefold: to identify the main challenges in the field of monitoring edge computing applications that are as yet not fully solved; to present a new taxonomy of monitoring requirements for adaptive applications orchestrated upon edge computing frameworks; and to discuss and compare the use of widely-used cloud monitoring technologies to assure the performance of these applications. Our analysis shows that none of existing widely-used cloud monitoring tools yet provides an integrated monitoring solution within edge computing frameworks. Moreover, some monitoring requirements have not been thoroughly met by any of them.
