Here we propose a low-cost automated system for the unobtrusive and continuous welfare monitoring of dairy cattle on the farm. We argue that effective and regular monitoring of multiple condition traits is not currently practicable and go on to propose 3D imaging technology able to acquire differing forms of related animal condition data (body condition, lameness and weight), concurrently using a single device. Results obtained under farm conditions in continuous operation are shown to be comparable or better than manual scoring of the herd. We also consider inherent limitations of using scoring and argue that sensitivity to relative change over successive observations offers greater benefit than the use of what may be considered abstract and arbitrary scoring systems.
