The max-Łukasiewicz semiring is defined as the unit interval [ 0 , 1 ] equipped with the arithmetics “ a + b ” = max ⁡ ( a , b ) and “ a b ” = max ⁡ ( 0 , a + b − 1 ) . Linear algebra over this semiring can be developed in the usual way. We observe that any problem of the max-Łukasiewicz linear algebra can be equivalently formulated as a problem of the tropical (max-plus) linear algebra. Based on this equivalence, we develop a theory of the matrix powers and the eigenproblem over the max-Łukasiewicz semiring.
