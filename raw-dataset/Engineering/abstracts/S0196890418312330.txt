The present work aims at the optimization of fins fitted phase change material equipped photovoltaic system under different working circumstances for proper power enhancement. Setup has been modelled and the best deepness of fins fitted phase change material enclosure has been computed for a range of daily collective solar flux at photovoltaic panel surface, wind pace, wind azimuth, surroundings temperature, melting point, successive fins distance, fins deepness and fins width in order to analyse the influence of working circumstances. It is shown that the change in wind pace from 0.2 m/s to 6 m/s results in reduction of best deepness of phase change material enclosure from 5.2 cm to 3.7 cm, 5.6 cm to 4.0 cm, 5.8 cm to 4.2 cm, 5.9 cm to 4.3 cm and 5.9 cm to 4.3 cm for successive fins distance of 1 m, 1/2 m, 1/3 m, 1/4 m and 1/5 m respectively for daily collective solar flux at photovoltaic panel as 5000Wh/m2. The change in wind azimuth from 0° to 75° results in increment in the best deepness of enclosure from 3.9 cm to 4.8 cm, 4.3 cm to 5.2 cm, 4.5 cm to 5.4 cm, 4.6 cm to 5.5 cm and 4.6 cm to 5.5 cm for respective fins distances. The power production is increased from 125 W/m2 to 137 W/m2, 140 W/m2, 142 W/m2, 143 W/m2 and 143 W/m2 with fins width of 0 mm, 0.5 mm, 1 mm, 2 mm and 4 mm respectively.
