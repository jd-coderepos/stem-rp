The definition of 3D workpiece coordinates for cylindrical involute gears, together with their formal relation to conventional cross sections, are prerequisites for an unambiguous and thus reliable evaluation of 3D measurement data. Both will be described in this article, as no corresponding information is currently available in national or international standards and guidelines. The definitions and calculation methods presented here are part of reference algorithms used by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), the national metrology institute of Germany, to certify gear evaluation software.
