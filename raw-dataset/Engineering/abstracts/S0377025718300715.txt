A dynamic two-scale model is developed for describing the mechanical behavior of suspensions of permeable ellipsoidal particles. The particle dynamics in the proposed model is described in terms of particle positions as well as conformation tensors that capture their size, shape, and orientation. Using non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the macroscopic fluid-dynamics and the particle dynamics on the microstructural level are mutually coupled in a consistent manner. So doing, the link between the macroscopic behavior, e.g. stresses, and the dynamics of the microstructure, e.g. particle shape and size, is established. Finally, the model is cast into a form in which the shape tensor is split into its volumetric and isochoric shape contributions, making it possible to model particles with both shape-preserving size-changes (e.g. swellable particles) and volume-preserving shape-changes (e.g. incompressible yet deformable particles). The size-shape model distinguishes itself in unifying prior knowledge of purely-shape models with that of purely-size models by appropriate choices of the Helmholtz free energy and the generalized mobility.
