We present a mathematical model for elastoplasticity in the regime where the applied stress greatly exceeds the yield stress. This scenario is typically found in violent impact testing, where millimetre thick metal samples are subjected to pressures on the order of 10–102 GPa, while the yield stress can be as low as 10−2 GPa. In such regimes the metal can be treated as a barotropic compressible fluid in which the strength, measured by the ratio of the yield stress to the applied stress, is negligible to lowest order. Our approach is to exploit the smallness of this ratio by treating the effects of strength as a small perturbation to a leading order barotropic model. We find that for uniaxial deformations, these additional effects give rise to features in the response of the material which differ significantly from the predictions of barotropic flow.
