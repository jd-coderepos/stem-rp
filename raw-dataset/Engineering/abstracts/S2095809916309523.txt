ABSTRACT The composition of fatty acids in triacylglycerides (TAGs) and their position on the glycerol backbone determine the nutritional value of vegetable oil. In this study, gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) were used to analyze the composition and distribution of fatty acids in TAGs of different rapeseed oils. Our results show the content of oleic acid in high-oleic-acid rapeseed oil to be about 80%. In terms of the number of acyl carbon atoms (CN), TAGs with CN52â€“C54 were most abundant, with a maximum concentration at CN54 (80%). The main type of TAG was oleic-oleic-oleic (OOO), accounting for 71.75%, while oleic-oleic-linoleic (OOL) accounted for 7.56%, oleic-oleic-linolenic (OOLn) accounted for 4.81%, and stearic-oleic-oleic (SOO) accounted for 4.74%. Oleic acid in high-oleic-acid rapeseed oil was distributed in the following order of preference: sn-2 > sn-1/3. In high-erucic-acid rapeseed oil, however, oleic acid was enriched at the sn-1/3. These data show that the content of oleic acid can be as high as about 80% in high-oleic-acid material. This finding suggests that high-oleic-acid rapeseed oil has high nutritional value.
