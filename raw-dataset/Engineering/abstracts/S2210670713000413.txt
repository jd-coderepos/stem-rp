The UK has set an ambitious plan to substantially cut its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In order to meet this 2050 target of 80% reduction, the UK is facing a significant challenge of restructuring its energy system. One way to do this is via the wider use of decentralised energy (DE) systems in urban areas. A significant lack of understanding exists however, regarding the main factors that drive these energy projects. Following semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, nine UK and four international exemplar cases have been analysed and critiqued in order to investigate the variety and inter-relationship of the drivers employed and involved encouraging their implementation. The role of regulation, and environmental awareness and concern as drivers for implementation are explored, as are the differing impacts of these drivers. Whilst academic literature commonly portrays financial incentives and the impact of policies as the main or initiating driver, many stakeholders investigated here emphasised the role of environmental awareness and concern as a prominent driver. Compliance with regulations and environmental awareness and concern seem not mutually exclusive; instead, environmental concern reinforces the willingness to comply (and over-comply) with the regulations.
