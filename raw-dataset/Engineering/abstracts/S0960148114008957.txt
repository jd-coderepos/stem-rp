A line absorber consisting of three cylindrical floats is shown to have high crest capture widths for wave energy conversion across a broad band of frequencies. The bow, mid and stern floats are small, medium and large respectively; the floats are spaced about half a wavelength apart so that forces and motion of adjacent floats are substantially in anti-phase. The bow and mid float are rigidly connected by a beam and a beam from the stern float is connected to a hinge above the mid float for power take off. The draft of the stern float enables heave resonance at a prominent wave frequency and the smaller draft of the mid float provides resonance at a somewhat lower frequency. Experimental results at about 1:8 scale show capture widths greater than 25% of a wavelength in regular waves and greater than 20% of a wavelength in irregular waves across a broad range of wave periods. A time-stepping model for regular waves with coefficients from linear diffraction theory showed similar power prediction with a generic drag coefficient of 1.8. The model shows the importance of surge forcing and heave resonance. The model also shows that reducing drag coefficient will increase capture width.
