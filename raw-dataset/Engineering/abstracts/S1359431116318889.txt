The paper presents a detailed computational-fluid-dynamic study of the thermodynamic losses associated with heat transfer in gas springs. This forms part of an on-going investigation into high-efficiency compression and expansion devices for energy conversion applications. Axisymmetric calculations for simple gas springs with different compression ratios and using different gases are first presented, covering Peclet numbers that range from near-isothermal to near-adiabatic conditions. These show good agreement with experimental data from the literature for pressure variations, wall heat fluxes and the so-called hysteresis loss. The integrity of the results is also supported by comparison with simplified models. In order to mimic the effect of the eddying motions generated by valve flows, non-axisymmetric computations have also been carried out for a gas spring with a grid (or perforated plate) of 30% open area located within the dead space. These show significantly increased hysteresis loss at high Peclet number which may be attributed to the enhanced heat transfer associated with grid-generated motions. Finally, the implications for compressor and expander performance are discussed.
