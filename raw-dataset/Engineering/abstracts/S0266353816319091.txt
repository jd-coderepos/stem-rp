Highly aligned intermingled fibre composites are produced from reclaimed and virgin carbon fibres using the High Performance Discontinuous Fibre (HiPerDiF) method. The stiffness and strength characteristics of these materials are studied as a function of the reclaimed to virgin fibres ratio. Interlaminated hybrid composites with discontinuous carbon fibre preforms sandwiched between continuous glass fibres are designed to demonstrate pseudo-ductility and allow investigation of the effect of the mixing ratio of reclaimed and virgin carbon fibres on the nonlinear stress-strain curve shape. The pseudo-ductile behaviour is explained by adapting the Damage Mode Map to describe the failure process of interlaminated hybrid specimens with different low elongation material strength. It is concluded that the HiPerDiF method is a valuable platform to remanufacture reclaimed carbon fibres into a high performance and potentially economical value recycled composite material. The Damage Mode Maps can be used to optimise the pseudo-ductile response of the interlaminated hybrid material.
