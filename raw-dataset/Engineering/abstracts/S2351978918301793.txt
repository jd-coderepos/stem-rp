Most of the current foundry processes are based on well-developed and established practices typical of mature technologies. Contemporary economic, environmental and societal developments have concurrently changed at an unprecedented rate the context where traditional metal casting methodologies have not really developed much over time. Consequently, significant challenges and opportunities arise. This work will present the founding metrics of a novel approach to metal casting with the development of a new philosophy (called “Small is Beautiful”) aimed at tackling the current pressures on the industry with a focus on energy and materials’ efficiencies and flexible production. Traditional and well-established parameters are presented and compared to new metrics defined from first principles and thermodynamic properties. All metrics are validated using industrial and scientific literature data of five sand casting plants melting different ferrous and non-ferrous alloys.
