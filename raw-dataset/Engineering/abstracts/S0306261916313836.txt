This work presents an economic and simple method to manufacture low cost, but effective adsorbents for CO2 capture through impregnating DETA to a low cost, porous silica gel. The results have demonstrated that the low cost silica gel impregnated by low molecular-weight amine is stable and work very well at a temperature up to 130Â°C. The developed adsorbent has a fast adsorption kinetics and can be regenerated at a low temperature. This will significantly reduce the energy used to desorb CO2, therefore the energy penalty. The effect of amine loading on the textural properties, thermal stability, and CO2 capture performance of the impregnated silica gel is also reported in this paper. 10% amine loading gives the best porosity, stability and the highest adsorption capacity.
