This paper explores innovative techniques by combining inorganic textile-based composites with thermal insulation for the simultaneous seismic and energy retrofitting of the existing old buildings. A brief state-of-the-art review on energy and seismic retrofitting materials and techniques is initially made, followed by the introduction of a novel concept for the simultaneous seismic and energy retrofitting of the Reinforced Concrete (RC) and masonry building envelopes, combining Textile Reinforced Mortar (TRM) jacketing and thermal insulation materials or systems. The hybrid structural-plus-energy retrofitting solutions examined are based on inorganic materials providing both cost effectiveness and fire resistance for the building envelope. The overall effectiveness of the combined energy and seismic retrofitting is demonstrated via a case study on a five stories old-type RC building. Moreover by proposing a common approach based on the expected annual loss (of consumed energy or expected seismic loss), it is possible to evaluate the financial feasibility and benefits of the proposed combined retrofitting approach. It was shown that the proposed concept is economically efficient as the payback period of the intervention (return of the retrofitting investment) can be significantly reduced for seismic zones when energy is applied concurrently with seismic retrofitting by exploiting advanced construction materials, thanks to large savings related to the labour costs.
