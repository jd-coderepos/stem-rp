The use of crushed concrete aggregate (CCA), formerly referred to as recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is increasing, particularly with a recent push towards sustainable sourcing of materials. Further research is required to understand the effect of coarse CCA on the mechanical properties and durability performance of structural concrete. The electrical resistivity, water absorption by capillary action and SEM analysis of CEM I and CEM III/A concretes were investigated to determine the effects on concrete microstructure and water ingress, together with compliance of characteristic (f c,cube) and target mean compressive strengths. The results show that for the three coarse CCA sources tested, the inclusion of coarse CCA generally has a detrimental effect on the microstructure and water ingress of structural concrete. These can be largely overcome through the incorporation of GGBS to produce CEM III/A concretes, allowing higher proportions of coarse CCA to be incorporated. We conclude that the GGBS and coarse CCA content be limited to 50% and 60% respectively, as this reduces the risk of a significant reduction of compressive cube strength and durability performance. The findings suggest that sustainable structural CEM III/A concrete can be a viable option for future responsibly sourced projects, provided that a reliable and consistent source of CCA can be obtained. This is a positive and significant outcome for the wider implementation of coarse CCA into structural concrete applications.
