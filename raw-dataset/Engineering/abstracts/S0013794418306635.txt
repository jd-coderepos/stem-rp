Many naturally occurring materials, such as wood and bone, have intricate porous micro-structures and high stiffness and toughness to density ratios. Here, the influence of pores in a material on crack dynamics in brittle fracture is investigated. A dynamic phase field finite element model is used to study the effects of pores with respect to crack path, crack propagation velocity and energy release rate in a strip specimen geometry with circular pores. Four different ordered pore distributions are considered, as well as randomly distributed pores. The results show that the crack is attracted by the pores; this attraction is stronger when there is more energy available for crack growth. Crack propagation through pores also enables higher crack propagation velocities than are normally seen in strip specimens without pores (i.e. homogeneous material), without a corresponding increase in energy release rate. It is further noticed that as the porosity of an initially solid material increases, the crack tip is increasingly likely to become shielded or arrested, which may be a key to the high relative strength often exhibited by naturally occurring porous materials. We also find that when a pore is of the same size as the characteristic internal length then the pore does not localise damage. Since the characteristic internal length only regularises the damage field and not the strain end kinetic energy distributions, crack dynamics are still affected by small pores.
