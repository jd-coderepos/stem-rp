We develop a new asymptotic model of the dynamic interaction between an elastic structure and a system of gyroscopic spinners that make the overall multi-structure chiral. An important result is the derivation and analysis of effective chiral boundary conditions describing the interaction between an elastic beam and a gyroscopic spinner. These conditions are applied to the analysis of waves in systems of beams connected by gyroscopic spinners. A new asymptotic and physical interpretation of the notion of a Rayleigh gyrobeam is also presented. The theoretical findings are accompanied by illustrative numerical examples and simulations.
