This article looks at the second law analysis of MHD boundary layer stagnation-point flow past over linearly stretched sheet. The thermal boundary condition is supposed to be non-isothermal and the effects of friction and Joule heating have been analysed. By using similarity transformations, the model nonlinear partial differential equations in two independent variables are reduced to ordinary differential equations. The numerical techniques, namely shooting and fourth order Runge-Kutta are used to give a numerical solution. An expression for dimensionless entropy generation and Bejan number are obtained and computed using velocity and temperature profiles. The main objective of this article is to analyse the effects of a magnetic parameter, Prandtl number, Eckert number, stretching parameter, mixed convection parameter and dimensionless temperature parameter on the volumetric rate of entropy production and Bejan number. It is found that entropy generation increases with enhancing values stretching parameter and decrease with the increasing values of dimensionless temperature parameter.
