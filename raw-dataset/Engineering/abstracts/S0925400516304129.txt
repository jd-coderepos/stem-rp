We report a new polydiacetylene (PDA) sensor strip for simple visual detection of zinc ions in aqueous solution. The specificity of this sensor comes from Zn2+ DNA aptamer probes conjugated onto PDA. Effects of aptamer length and structure on the sensitivity of PDAâ€™s color transition were first investigated. PDA conjugated with the optimal aptamer sequence was then coated onto a strip of polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and photopolymerized by UV exposure. The newly developed sensor successfully exhibited a blue-to-red chromatic change in a semi-quantitative manner in response to zinc ions. No discernable change was observed in solutions containing other common ions. Advantages of this sensor include its ease of fabrication, high specificity, and equipment-free detection, all of which are desirable for in-field applications and use in resource-limited settings.
