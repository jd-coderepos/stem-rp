The impact of a uniform bore on an erodible beach is investigated using a shallow water description and a sediment conservation equation. The solution, which is obtained using the method of characteristics, employs a cubic bed-load formula and a crudely calibrated sediment transport coefficient. It is found that, as with the fixed bed case of Hibberd and Peregrine (1979), a backwash bore forms, which for the mobile bed also comprises a bed step. It is found that this bed step achieves a significant height. The volume of sand deposited above the final still water level is consistent with that observed under certain events on some sandy beaches.
