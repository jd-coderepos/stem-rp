The effect of laser trepanning speed and, as a result, recast layer thickness on the high temperature corrosion fatigue behaviour of CMSX-4 superalloy acute angled holes was investigated. The experimental test results show that an increasing laser drilling speed caused a reduction in corrosion fatigue life by 35–50% at 850°C, under low cycle fatigue regime. This reduction was found to correlate directly with the recast layer thickness and surface anomalies within the recast layer produced during the laser drilling process. Corrosion had a smaller effect on the overall life of the laser drilled specimens under the conditions tested. The results presented show that laser trepanning speed is influential in limiting the life performance of laser drilled components in service.
