The shock stabilisation and wave drag reduction potential of a two-dimensional adaptive shock control bump has been studied in the Imperial College supersonic wind tunnel. The bump was modelled as a flexible aluminium alloy plate deformed through spanwise actuation, and several bump heights were tested beneath a Mach 1.4 transonic shock wave. Schlieren images and static pressure readings along the flexible plate allowed the study of the λ -shock structure generated by the bifurcation of the normal shock for a range of shock positions. All bumps tested were found to increase shock stability, but wave drag reduction was only observed for shocks close to the leading edge of the flexible plate. Positive deformations of the flexible plate for downstream shocks are believed to reduce supersonic flow reacceleration, and hence the strength of the rear leg of the λ -shock and wave drag, in comparison to a solid bump with the same shape. The position of the rear leg of the λ -shock was found to exhibit a bistable behaviour, and this is hypothesised to be caused by a complex coupling of aerodynamic and structural instabilities.
