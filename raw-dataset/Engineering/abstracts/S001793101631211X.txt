Here we present the mass transfer coefficient for liquid–solid mass transfer to a rotating mesh electrode and a smooth flat disc electrode in a rotor–stator spinning disc reactor. The mass transfer coefficients are measured with the limiting current density technique. Additionally, the torque is measured and the energy dissipation rate in the system is calculated. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient of the mesh electrode increases a factor 5 compared to that of the flat disc electrode at virtually equal energy dissipation rates. Due to the characteristics of the mesh, the mesh electrode offers 2.77 times higher electrode area than the flat disc. The mass transfer coefficients measured for the rotating mesh electrode are a factor 1.74 higher compared to the flat disc. Average Sherwood numbers are reported and a correlation is presented that predicts mass transfer rates of rotating meshes in rotor–stator spinning disc reactor configurations.
