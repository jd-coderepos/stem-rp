This study investigated the mechanical and permeability properties of Ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) under autoclaving and water curing conditions. The influence of autoclave time and incorporation of five different dosages of fly ash were also examined. Test results revealed a considerable increase in compressive strength of UHPC after water curing. Also, the mechanical performance of UHPC was significantly influenced by the autoclave time and temperature and could be affected negatively beyond the stated value. In addition, the effects of fly ash dosage on the permeability of UHPC were studied. Increase in the workability of the concrete mixes as the dosage of fly ash increased from 0% to 40% was reported.
