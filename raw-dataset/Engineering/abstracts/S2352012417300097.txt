Insufficient axial capacity of large-diameter plain-pipe grouted connections has recently been observed in offshore wind turbine substructures across Europe. Aimed at understanding the implications of this phenomenon, a campaign of structural condition monitoring was undertaken. The measurements showed significant axial displacements occurring between the transition piece and the monopile, which in turn resulted in a considerable amount of wear. Given the existing lack of technical data on the implications that this relative movement has on the wear of grouted connections, a methodology was developed to quantify the likely risk to the foundation integrity of the wear failure mode. The proposed approach consists of a numerical model which applies the wear rate derived from previous experimental testing to the conditions experienced by typical offshore grouted connections, as indicated by the wind turbine generators' supervisory control and data acquisition systems. The output of this model showed that, for a representative sample of the wind farm substructures analysed as a case study, the accumulated lifetime wear would be minimal in the majority of the grouted connection, i.e. less than 0.4mm over 75% of the connection, but a much greater loss in thickness, of the order of 4mm, was predicted at the very top and bottom of the connection. This assessment is based on the assumptions that no significant changes occur in the surrounding environmental conditions and that the degradation in the grouted connection does not significantly affect the dynamic response of the foundation structure over its life span. Importantly, these assumptions may affect the model's predictions in terms of cumulated wear over time, not in terms of identifying the individual connections to be prioritised when performing remedial work, which is indeed the main intended use of the model.
