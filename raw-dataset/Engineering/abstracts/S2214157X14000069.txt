In this study, photovoltaic module temperature has been predicted according to outlet air temperature and solar radiation. For this investigation, photovoltaic module temperatures have been determined in the experimental system for 10, 20, 30, and 40°C ambient air temperature and different solar radiations. This experimental study was made in open air and solar radiation was measured and then this measured data was used for the training of ANN. Photovoltaic module temperatures have been predicted according to solar radiation and outside air temperature for the Aegean region in Turkey. Electrical efficiency and power was also calculated depending on the predicted module temperature. Kütahya, Uşak and Afyon are the most suitable cities in terms of electrical efficiency and power product in the Aegean region in Turkey.
