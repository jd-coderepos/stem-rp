A new algorithm for the solution of the system of three Boltzmann equations for three components in a mixture is developed. Binary collisions between molecules are taken into account assuming that these collisions are elastic or inelastic. The functionality testing of the algorithm is performed using a simple test problem of heat and mass transfer in the mixture of n-dodecane, p-dipropylbenzene and nitrogen between two infinite parallel walls. The mixture of n-dodecane and p-dipropylbenzene is chosen due to the fact that it can approximate realistic Diesel fuels reasonably well. It is concluded that the predictions of the new kinetic algorithm are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of more basic models of the phenomena for which it has been tested. The algorithm is ready for the analysis of a wider range of heat and mass transfer problems in which the contribution of three components in the mixture is essential.
