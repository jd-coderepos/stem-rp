The main purpose of conducting this study is to determine the difference in the bending capacity between a singly reinforced monolithic beam and a singly reinforced beam with a construction joint at the beam center, for a range of different compressive strength (fâ€™c) of concrete. Testing was conducted according to applicable ASTM standards. During humongous construction projects, it is very rare to build a concrete structure without instigating the use of construction joints, whether by design or by de facto forces. On site, the construction supervisor would contemplate whether one could relate the bending capacity of the concrete beam with the use of accidently imposed construction joint. Thus it is very essential to determine the effect the construction joint has on the flexural bending capacity of the concrete. Provided are charts to account for the loss in the bending capacity of singly reinforced beam in the existence of a construction joint for a specific concrete compressive strength.
