The temperature-dependent dwell sensitivity of Ti-6242 and Ti-6246 alloys has been assessed over a temperature range from − 50 ∘ C to 390 °C using discrete dislocation plasticity which incorporates both thermal activation of dislocation escape from obstacles and slip transfer across grain boundaries. The worst-case load shedding in Ti-6242 alloy is found to be at or close to 120 °C under dwell fatigue loading, which diminishes and vanishes at temperatures lower than − 50 ∘ C or higher than 230 °C. Load shedding behaviour is predicted to occur in alloy Ti-6246 also but over a range of higher temperatures which are outside those relevant to in-service conditions. The key controlling dislocation mechanism with respect to load shedding in titanium alloys, and its temperature sensitivity, is shown to be the time constant associated with the thermal activation of dislocation escape from obstacles, with respect to the stress dwell time. The mechanistic basis of load shedding and dwell sensitivity in dwell fatigue loading is presented and discussed in the context of experimental observations.
