Bentonite clays will be used as barriers in geological repositories for radioactive wastes. Anoxic conditions will prevail in such repositories, and the presence of sulphide-producing bacteria in commercial bentonites and deep groundwater environments is well established. In this study, sulphide was found to reduce ferric iron in bentonites denoted Asha, MX-80 and Calcigel under the formation of elemental sulphur, ferrous iron and iron sulphide. These reactions rendered an immobilisation capacity of the clays that was 40μmole sulphide (g clay)−1 or more, depending on the load of sulphide, and type of clay. In addition, the effective diffusion coefficients for sulphide in Asha bentonite, compacted to saturated wet densities of 1750kg m−3 and 2000kg m−3, were determined to 2.74×10−11 m2 s−1 and 6.60×10−12 m2 s−1, respectively. The found immobilisation effect can reduce the mass of sulphide that corrode metal canisters over repository life times, but the concomitant reduction of ferric iron may be problematic due to the destabilizing effect of ferrous iron on dioctahedral smectites such as montmorillonites.
