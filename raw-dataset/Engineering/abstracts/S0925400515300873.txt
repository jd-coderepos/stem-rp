An optical fibre long period grating (LPG) modified with a thin film of ZIF-8, a zeolitic immidazol framework material and a subgroup of metal organic framework family, was employed for the detection of organic vapours. ZIF-8 films were deposited onto the surface of the LPG using an in-situ crystallization technique by mixing freshly prepared 12.5mM zinc nitrate hexahydrate and 25mM 2-metyl-imidazole solutions in methanol. The ZIF-8 film was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The thickness and refractive index (RI) of films deposited after 1,2,3,5 and 10 growth cycles were determined by using an ellipsometer. The crystallinity of the films was confirmed by X-ray diffraction pattern. The LPG was designed to operate at the phase matching turning point to provide the highest sensitivity. The sensing mechanism is based on the measurement of the change in the RI of the film induced by the penetration of the chemical molecules into the ZIF-8 pores. The responses of LPGs modified with 2 and 5 growth cycles of ZIF-8 to exposure to methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and acetone were characterised. The sensitivity of the measurements to humidity as an interfering parameter was also investigated.
