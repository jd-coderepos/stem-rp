In this paper, the half-skip configuration of the Total Focusing Method (TFM) is used to image and size surface-breaking cracks. The TFM is an ultrasonic array post-processing technique which is used to synthetically focus at every image point in a target region. This paper considers the case of inspecting for cracks which have initiated from the far surface of a parallel-sided sample using an array on the near surface. Typically, only direct ray paths between the array and image points are included in the TFM algorithm and therefore the image obtained for this case consists only of root and tip indications; no specular reflection from the crack faces is captured. The tip indication often has such a poor signal-to-noise ratio that reliable crack depth measurement is challenging. With the Half-Skip TFM, instead of using directly-scattered signals, the image is formed using ultrasonic ray paths corresponding to the ultrasound that has reflected off the back surface and has then undergone specular reflection from the crack face back to the array. The technique is applied to experimental and simulated array data and is shown to measure the depth of small cracks (depth <1mm) with greater reliability than methods which rely on tip diffraction.
