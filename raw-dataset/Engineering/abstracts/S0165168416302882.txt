Sparse representation classification (SRC) is being widely investigated on hyperspectral images (HSI). For SRC methods to achieve high classification performance, not only is the development of sparse representation models essential, the designing and learning of quality dictionaries also plays an important role. That is, a redundant dictionary with well-designated atoms is required in order to ensure low reconstruction error, high discriminative power, and stable sparsity. In this paper, we propose a new method to learn such dictionaries for HSI classification. We borrow the concept of joint sparse model (JSM) from SRC to dictionary learning. JSM assumes local smoothness and joint sparsity and was initially proposed for classification of HSI. We leverage JSM to develop an extension of discriminative K-SVD for learning a promising discriminative dictionary for HSI. Through a semi-supervised strategy, the new dictionary learning method, termed JSM-DKSVD, utilises all spectrums over the local neighbourhoods of labelled training pixels for discriminative dictionary learning. It can produce a redundant dictionary with rich spectral and spatial information as well as high discriminative power. The learned dictionary can then be compatibly used in conjunction with the established SRC methods, and can significantly improve their performance for HSI classification.
