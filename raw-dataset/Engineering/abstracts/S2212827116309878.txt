Through the Internet of Things (IoT) interaction between objects becomes possible in a way we have never seen before. With the advent of IoT and its introduction into almost all aspects of life, safety and security of IoT devices has to be considered for their whole life cycle. This concerns not only the large amounts of data that needs to be exchanged securely but also the design of the hardware of the devices themselves. Security has to be designed right from the start into IoT devices rather than added on later. This paper will introduce a global strategy for secure Design for IoT which includes: • Safe solutions for environments with rich information • Guarantee that the devices are functioning as intended by the manufacturer and are not damaged • Life cycle security across devices, networks and data centers • Support for industry standards and interoperability of devices • Ability to solve the challenges of the information link • Secure Clouds for traditional systems. This paper lays the foundation for the creation of a safe remote monitoring system for machine tools through IoT devices and analyses the critical issues focusing on the manufacturing environment.
