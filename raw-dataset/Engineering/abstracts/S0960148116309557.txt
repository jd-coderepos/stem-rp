In this work we describe the relative performance of the largest luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) constructed to date. Comparisons are made for performance of North/South and East/West facing panels during a sunny day. It is shown that the East/West panels display much more varied performance during the day, as the structural elements of the barrier interfere with solar illumination and cause shading, but perform similarly for both front and back illumination conditions. The results of a more extended, 200 day measurement period mirror the results of the single sunny day results. This work demonstrates the importance of frame design to minimize self-shading of the LSC panels.
