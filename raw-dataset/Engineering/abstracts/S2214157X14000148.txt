The objective of the current study is to examine experimentally the thin-layer drying behavior of quince slices as a function of drying conditions. In a laboratory thermal convective dryer, experiments were conducted at air temperatures of 40, 50 and 60°C and average air velocities of 1, 2 and 3ms−1. Increasing temperature and velocity resulted to a decrease of the total time of drying. The experimental data in terms of moisture ratio were fitted with three state-of-the-art thin-layer drying models. In the ranges measured, the values of the effective moisture diffusivity (D eff ) were obtained between 2.67×10−10 and 8.17×10−10 m2 s−1. The activation energy (E α ) varied between 36.99 and 42.59kJmol−1.
