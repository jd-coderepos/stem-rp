This study adopts three-dimensional scanning technology to obtain accurate pit corrosion data to research corroded reinforcement morphology. The pitting factors α and β are proposed to quantify the corrosion degree along the axial and transverse directions of corroded bars, and both factors’ probability distributions are analysed. The experimental results show that the probability distribution of α and the majority of β conform to lognormal distribution. When the value of η (the mass loss ratio) increases, the value of pitting factor α decreases and tends to be stable, while the expectation of β decreases, indicating that the corrosion pits tend to be uniform when corrosion becomes severe. Comparing the trend of corrosion depth with pitting factor α along the bar length, reveals that α has more regularity.
