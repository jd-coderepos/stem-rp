Fusion technology deployment passes through the design of safety systems aimed to protect the Vacuum Vessel (VV) from pressurizing accidents event such as LOVA (Loss Of Vacuum Accident) or the failure of the Tokamak Water Cooling System (TWCS) causing the LOCA (Loss Of Coolant Accident). One of important safety systems of the ITER plant is the Vacuum Vessel Pressure Suppression System (VVPSS), which is designed to protect the VV by the steam condensation at sub-atmospheric pressure conditions in Suppression Tanks. The aim of this study is to investigate vibrations phenomenon, originated during the steam-water direct contact condensation (DCC) at sub-atmospheric conditions, and determine any correlations between the steam jet dynamic and water temperature (TW), steam mass flux (GS) and downstream pressure (PW). According to the thermal hydraulic conditions characterising the DCC, vibrations may evolve because of the latent heat of the phase change (large amount of heat transmitted quickly to the water). In the paper also presents the numerical investigations performed by means of proper FEM code, the set-up procedure and the experimental activity carried out at Lab. B. Guerrini of DICI- University of Pisa. This latter allowed correlating the different steam condensation regimes (chugging, condensation oscillation, etc.) to the acceleration and force, to be in turn used to determine the strength capacity of the VVPSS.
