This work assesses the hygrothermal and ventilation performance of two ‘hard-to-treat’ historic, clay brick, solid wall houses that are internally insulated. Retrofit A is a two bedroom bungalow with the addition of internal plasterboard and air cavity and Retrofit B is a 5 bedroom house with sheep wool, phenolic and plasterboard insulation. To evaluate the long term performance of the retrofit measures, the testing is carried out 7 and 8 years respectively after completion. The first part of the work investigates whole building hygrothermal performance, ventilation and internal conditions. It was found that both retrofits are operating below specification in regards to their ventilation performance. An in-situ performance based specification for mechanical ventilation via CO2 monitoring is proposed. The second part focuses on the hygrothermal behaviour of the clay brick wall assembly. Both presented high relative humidity within critical layers of the wall make up. In Retrofit A the wall thermal transmittance was found to be much higher than designed due to inappropriate construction detailing while Retrofit B showed excellent thermal performance and minimal effects of thermal bridging.
