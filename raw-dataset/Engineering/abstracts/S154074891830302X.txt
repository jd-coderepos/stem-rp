The intricate coupling between coal pyrolysis, gas phase combustion and the emissions of alkali metal, such as sodium, is studied in the early stage of a temporally evolving three-dimensional planar turbulent jet carrying pulverized-coal particles. Complex chemistry is used to account for both the combustion of volatile hydrocarbons and the sodium containing species. The response of the sodium chemistry is analyzed in the mixture fraction space, along with the topology of the reactions zones. Combustion is found to start preferentially in partially premixed flames, which then evolve toward diffusion-like reactive layers and reach chemical equilibrium. From the direct numerical simulation (DNS) database, the possibility of modeling the dynamics of sodium species using one-dimensional premixed flamelet generated manifolds (FGM) is investigated. A chemical lookup table is constructed for the combustion of the partially premixed volatiles and an additional three-dimensional simulation is performed to compare the tabulated sodium species against their reference counterparts with complex chemistry. Quantitative analysis of the performance of the developed chemistry tabulation confirms the validity of the approach. Perspectives for the modeling of sodium emissions in pulverized-coal furnaces and boilers are finally drawn.
