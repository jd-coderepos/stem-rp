Knowledge of labor productivity is essential for cost estimation and progress control. Due to the limited availability of automatic generation technology for integrated information including both physical component attributes (such as spatial information) and managerial attributes (such as allocated resources), research efforts focusing on cost-time integrated progress control theory have been sparse. However, current advances in 3D building information modeling (BIM) applications have allowed for the practical development of BIM-based visual progress control systems. The goal of this research is to explore the importance of labor productivity data for measuring compound progress. Therefore, this paper develops a field labor productivity data acquisition method by integrating a 3D model with associated information. To evaluate the proposed method, a case project and field data were used to assess productivity. The results of this research are discussed in terms of significant findings and potential further developments.
