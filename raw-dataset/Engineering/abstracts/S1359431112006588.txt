In this study, a coupled two-dimensional transient model was developed to predict the temperature, moisture content and oil uptake as encountered in industrial continuous deep fryers. The set of transient governing equations developed were solved numerically with the variable time-step finite volume method. The mathematical model can be used to analyse the effects of different frying conditions on the moisture, oil and temperature profiles during the frying processes. Numerical results are presented to show the applicability of the developed model and can help researchers and designers to ascertain optimum operational conditions of frying processes. The physical and mathematical construction of the model not only allows extension of the formulae so that the frame of the model can be used in other similar food processes systems, but also utilizes the dynamic characteristics of the fryer for development and evaluation of advanced control strategies.
