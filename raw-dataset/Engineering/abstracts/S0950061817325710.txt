Laminated bamboo in structural applications has the potential to change the way buildings are constructed. The fibrous microstructure of bamboo can be modelled as a fibre-reinforced composite. This study compares the results of a fibre volume fraction analysis with previous experimental beam bending results. The link between fibre volume fraction and bending stiffness shows that differences previously attributed to preservation treatment in fact arise due to strip thickness. Composite theory provides a basis for the development of future guidance for laminated bamboo, as validated here. Fibre volume fraction analysis is an effective method for non-destructive evaluation of bamboo beam stiffness.
