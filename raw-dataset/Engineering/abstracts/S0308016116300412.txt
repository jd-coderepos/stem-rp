A fatigue-resistant cladding concept confirms the presence of compressive residual stresses in a cylinder weld clad with 17–4 PH stainless steel while tensile residual stresses exist in an Inconel 625 clad layer. In this study, autofrettage of an Inconel 625 thick-walled clad cylinder is investigated with modified residual stress distributions obtained indicating that tensile residual stresses throughout the clad layer are transformed to compressive in nature, discontinuity stresses at the clad/substrate interface are almost entirely eliminated and compressive residual stresses exist to a depth of around 18 mm. An alternative clad material, 17–4 PH stainless steel, is investigated resulting in compressive residual stresses in the clad layer without the need for autofrettage. The complexity of modelling a martensitic stainless steel is discussed and sensitivity studies undertaken to illustrate the influence of coefficient of thermal expansion on resulting residual stresses. Strain hardening effects and the assumption of an idealised interface are discussed. Contour method measurements prove that discontinuity stresses are reduced in reality due to alloying and diffusion effects, highlighting also the need for further characterisation of 17–4 PH. Additional considerations such as the weld clad profile and process parameters are briefly discussed.
