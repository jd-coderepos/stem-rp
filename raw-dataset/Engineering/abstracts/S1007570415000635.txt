In this paper, a two-delay model for the ultradian oscillatory behaviour of the glucose–insulin regulation system is studied. Hill functions are introduced to model nonlinear physiological interactions within this system and ranges on parameters reproducing biological oscillations are determined on the basis of analytical and numerical considerations. Local and global stability are investigated and delay-dependent conditions are obtained through the construction of Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals. The effect of Hill parameters on these conditions, as well as the boundary of the stability region in the delay domain, are established for the first time. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the model with Hill functions represents well the oscillatory behaviour of the system with the advantage of incorporating new meaningful parameters. The influence of the time delays on the period of oscillations and the sensitivity of the latter to model parameters, in particular glucose infusion, are investigated. The model can contribute to the better understanding and treatment of diabetes.
