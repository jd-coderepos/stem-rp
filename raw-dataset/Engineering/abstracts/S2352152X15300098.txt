Thermal energy storage in packed beds is receiving increased attention as a necessary component for efficient implementation of concentrated solar power plants. A simplified, one-equation thermal model for the behavior of a packed bed is presented for α-alumina as solid storage material and air as the heat transfer fluid. The model successfully predicts the thermocline behavior over time. Two flow rates during storage are presented for alumina in a cylindrical packed bed. Temperature-dependent thermophysical properties are utilized to accurately model the systems. An additional study of air and alumina at high temperature (700°C) is presented to further highlight the importance of variable thermophysical properties in real models. Explicit consideration is given to explain situations where the modeling approach is valid based on a Biot number analysis and the thermal capacities of the solid and fluid.
