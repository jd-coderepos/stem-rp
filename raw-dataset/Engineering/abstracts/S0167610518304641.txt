A high density ground surface observation network has been realized by about 150 POTEKAs and has a resolution of approximately 2 km in Gunma and Saitama prefectures in Japan. POTEKA (POint TEnki KAnsoku in Japanese) is a compact weather station which can observe seven meteorological variables such as wind speed, wind direction, temperature, pressure, humidity, sunshine and rain. In this observation network, the verification observation has been performed for about 5 years since 2013, and we have succeeded in observing 11 cases of downbursts and damaging gusts, which included 5 events in the F1 category (Fujita scale). By detailed analysis of the F1 downbursts which were accompanied by substantial damage (particularly the downburst on June 15, 2015), the transition characteristics of meteorological variables such as wind, temperature and pressure have been clarified while downburst occurrence. Moreover, we have been able to estimate the actual scale of a downburst.
