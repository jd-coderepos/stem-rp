Austenitic welds are inspected using PPM EMAT generated shear horizontal (SH) waves. Results are compared to measurements taken using a 1D piezoelectric phased array using the total focusing method (TFM). For the first time there is clear experimental evidence of the SH wave method demonstrating higher sensitivity to defect detection. SH waves suffer less beam steering in a weld than either compression or SV waves, which can miss defects due to weld microstructure anisotropy and attenuation. All defects were identified from every side of the weld/plate using the SH waves, but this was not possible using the piezoelectric transducer.
