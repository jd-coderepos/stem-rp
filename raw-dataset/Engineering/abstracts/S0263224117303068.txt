Current definitions and computation of areal surface texture parameters are based on planar, measured or unwrapped, surface which is not applicable for non planar irregular meshes. In this paper an extension of areal surface texture parameters (height and hybrid parameters) for freeform surface is proposed. The proposed method can be used for both general and complex surfaces and it works well on surfaces where there are undercuts and non uniformly spaced points. The proposed method has been tested on six sets of different types of surfaces and the computed parameter results were compared with the values of the parameters defined in ISO 25178-2:2012.
