We consider a vibrating triangular mass-truss lattice whose unit cell contains a resonator of triangular shape. The resonators are connected to the ambient lattice by trusses. Each resonator is tilted, i.e. it is rotated with respect to the ambient lattice’s unit cell through an angle ϑ0. This geometrical parameter is responsible for the emergence of a resonant mode in the Bloch spectrum for elastic waves and strongly affects the dispersive properties of the lattice. Additionally, the tilting angle ϑ0 triggers the opening of a band gap at a Dirac-like point. We provide a physical interpretation of these phenomena and discuss the dynamical implications on elastic Bloch waves. The dispersive properties are used to design a structured interface containing tilted resonators which exhibit negative refraction and focussing, as in a “flat elastic lens”.
