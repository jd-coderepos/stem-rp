The design of high-strength martensitic stainless steels requires an accurate control over the stability of undesired phases, like carbides and ferrite, which can hamper strength and ductility. Here, the ferrite to austenite transformation in Fe-11Cr-0.06C has been studied with a combined experimental-modelling approach. Experimental observations of the austenization process indicate that austenite growth proceeds in multiple steps, each one characterized by a different transformation rate. DICTRA based modelling reveals that the dissolution of the M23C6 Cr-rich carbides leads to Cr partitioning between austenite and parent phases, which controls the rate of transformation through (i) a soft-impingement effect and (ii) consequent stabilization of the ferrite, which remains untransformed inside chromium-enriched-zones even after prolonged austenization stage. Slow heating rate and smaller initial particle sizes allow the design of ferrite-free microstructure.
