The paper studies the influence of internal pressure on circular thin-walled pipes ( D / t > 150 ) subjected to pure bending. Both straight pipes and curved pipes are analysed. Both yield and buckling failures are considered. It is shown that internal pressure decreases the limiting load for yield but increases the limiting load for buckling. The study is mainly FEA-based. A formula to predict critical moment given by linear buckling analysis is proposed. Comments on difference between linear and non-linear analysis results are given. It is shown that a pipe curvature opposite to the bending moment can increase the critical load. It is shown that cylindrical thin-walled shells have an optimal value of internal pressure to which limiting load for yield and critical buckling moment are equal, corresponding to an optimal use of material.
