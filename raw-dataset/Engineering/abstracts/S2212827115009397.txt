Current developments in “Wire+Arc Additive Manufacturing” (WAAM) have demonstrated the suitability of the technology for rapid, delocalized and flexible manufacturing. Providing a defence platform with the ability of on-board WAAM capability, would give the platform unique advantages such as improved availability of its systems and ability to recover its capability after being subject to shock. This paper aims to investigate WAAM technology and define a WAAM based manufacturing system for In-platform applications.
