In this study, detection and measurement of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentration has been achieved by electrochemical method in one operation step. Multilayer films of poly(dimethyldiallyammonium chloride) (PDA) wrapped multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and two enzymes acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOD) were assembled on a carbon screen printed electrode by the layer-by-layer (LbL) immobilization. The fine polymer–enzyme layers produced by the LbL method, allowed mass transport from the reactant cascading down the layers to accomplish the two-step enzyme reactions. The polymer–CNTs and enzyme modified electrode exhibited good electrocatalytical property retaining enzyme activity. Linear increase of anodic current from H2O2 produced from NEFA oxidation was observed with the increasing concentrations of oleic acid. These results indicate a promising technique for a simple, rapid one-step determination of NEFA for diabetes management.
