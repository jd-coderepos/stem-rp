Globally, there are vast amounts of low-grade heat sources from industrial waste and renewables that can be converted into electricity through advanced thermodynamic power cycles and appropriate working fluids. In terms of the working fluidâ€™s environmental impact, temperature match of cycle heat processes and system compactness, CO2 transcritical power cycles (T-CO2) were deemed more applicable for low-grade heat to power conversion. However, the system thermal efficiency of a T-CO2 requires further improvement. Subsequently, a test rig of the small-scale power generation system with T-CO2 power cycles was developed with essential connected components. These include a plate thermal coil CO2 supercritical heater, a CO2 transcritical turbine, a plate recuperator, an air-cooled finned-tube CO2 condenser and a CO2 liquid pump. Various preliminary test results from the system measurements are demonstrated in this paper. Meanwhile, the system model has been developed and applied to predict system performance at different operating conditions. The simulation results can therefore instruct further design and optimisation of system and components.
