This study investigated by an analytical method the flow that develops in the gap between concentric rotating cylinders when the Taylor number T a exceeds the first critical value. Concentric cylinders rotating at the speed ratio μ = 0 are investigated over the radius ratio range 0 . 20 ≤ η ≤ 0 . 95 . This range includes configurations characterised by a larger annular gap width d than classical journal bearing test cases and by a Taylor number beyond the first critical Taylor number at which Taylor vortices develop. The analysis focuses on determining the parameters for the direct transition from axisymmetric Couette flow to wavy Taylor vortex flow. The results show a marked change in trend as the radius ratio η reduces below 0.49 and 0.63 for the azimuthal wave-numbers m = 2 and 3 respectively. The axial wavenumber increases so that the resulting wavy Taylor vortex flow is characterised by vortex structures elongated in the radial direction, with a meridional cross-section that is significantly elliptical. The linear stability analysis of the perturbation equations suggests this instability pattern is neutrally stable. Whereas a direct transition from axisymmetric Couette flow is not necessarily the only route for the onset of wavy Taylor vortex flow, the significant difference between the predicted pattern at large gap widths and classical wavy Taylor vortex flow merits further investigation.
