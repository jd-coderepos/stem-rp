Sieving of Dutch raw sewage over a 350μm screen, produces a cake layer called fine sieved fraction (FSF), an energy-rich material that contains mainly cellulosic fibers originating from toilet paper. The FSF biomethane potential (BMP) was studied under both mesophilic (35°C) and thermophilic (55°C) conditions, whereas the stability of the fed-batch digesters at both 35°C and 55°C was researched by varying the inoculum to substrate ratios (RI / S : 0.5–15). Results clearly showed advantages of thermophilic conditions over mesophilic conditions at all tested RI / S . Stable digestion was even possible at an RI / S of 0.5 at 55°C. Following the results of the batch tests, a compact high loaded thermophilic digester for on-site energy recovery from FSF was proposed. Based on the results of the study, high biogas production rates at high organic loading rates (OLRs) were predicted. In the energy balance calculations, surplus heat production from combined heat and power (CHP) was utilized to dry the digestate sludge before transportation to an incineration plant or for use in pyrolysis or gasification processes. Overall results showed the potential of generating 46% of the required energy for wastewater treatment via high rate FSF digestion and subsequent conversion of the bio-methane into electricity and heat. The net recoverable energy from fine sieving, anaerobic digestion of FSF, dewatering of digestate sludge and drying of dewatered digestate sludge amounted 287MJ/ton FSF and 237kWh electric/ton FSF at 23% TS.
