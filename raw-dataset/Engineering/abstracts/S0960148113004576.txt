This paper considers life cycle environmental sustainability of solar water heating systems in regions with low solar irradiation, such as the UK. The results suggest that flat plate collectors have slightly lower environmental impacts than evacuated tube designs. Reducing the current energy losses of 65%â€“45% would reduce the impacts by around 35%. Compared to a gas boiler, solar thermal systems are a better option for only five out of 11 environmental impacts considered, with global warming and depletion of fossil resources being lower by 88% and 83%, respectively. Other impacts such as human and eco-toxicity are up to 85% higher. The solar systems score better relative to electrical water heating for eight out of 11 impacts. They are also environmentally more sustainable than heat pumps for seven categories. However, their potential is hampered because they need a back-up heating system, typically gas boiler. For this reason as well as due to a lack of suitable locations and poor efficiency, the potential of solar thermal systems to contribute to a more sustainable domestic energy supply in the UK is limited.
