High energy neutrons produced in future fusion reactors will cause significant transmutation reactions in the breeder blanket, including the important tritium breeding reactions. The reaction rate for a given reaction type depends on the neutron spectrum and material properties. The inventory consequences for tritium production of a solid-type breeder blanket are discussed in this paper. A DEMO fusion reactor with 19 homogeneous breeder blanket modules made of Eurofer, helium, Be12Ti and Li4SiO4, with enriched Li 6 content. Each blanket module was segmented radially in order to analyse the time-dependent reaction rate as a function of depth. The resolution of radial segmentation was varied and 5 radial divisions were found to be sufficient to accurately model the tritium inventory. Time-dependent tritium production was simulated with the use of the interface code, FATI, which couples radiation transport code MCNP 6 with the inventory code FISPACT-II. The simulated results show how the tritium production varies over the expected lifetime of the blanket. The overall tritium production of the solid-type blanket decreases as the Li 6 and Li 7 are burnt up. The effect of Li 6 burn-up in the breeder zones nearest to the plasma is identified as the main contributing factor to the decreasing tritium production of the whole breeder blanket.
