Piezo-actuated flexure-based precision positioning platforms have been widely used in micro/nano manipulation. A conventional major challenge is the trade-off between high rigidity, large magnification, high-precision tracking, and high-accuracy positioning. A compact planar three-degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) nanopositioning platform is described in which three two-level lever amplifiers are arranged symmetrically to achieve large magnification. The parallel-kinematic configuration with optimised sizes increases the rigidity. Displacement loss models (DLM) are proposed for the external preload port of the actuator, the input port of the platform and the flexible lever mechanism. The kinematic and dynamic modelling accuracies are improved by the compensation afforded by the three DLMs. Experimental results validate the proposed design and modelling methods. The proposed platform possesses high rigidity, large magnification, high-precision circle tracking and high-accuracy positioning.
