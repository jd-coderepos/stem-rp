Due to the increasing windage area of container ships, wind loads are playing a more important role in navigating the ship at open sea and especially through harbor areas. This paper presents 3D steady RANS CFD simulations of wind loads on a container ship, validation with wind-tunnel measurements and an analysis of the impact of geometrical simplifications. For the validation, CFD simulations are performed in a narrow computational domain resembling the cross-section of the wind tunnel. Blockage effects caused by the domain boundaries are studied by comparing CFD results in the wind tunnel domain and a larger domain. The average absolute difference in numerically simulated and measured total wind load on the ship ranges from 37.9% for a simple box-shaped representation of the ship to only 5.9% for the most detailed model. Modeling the spaces in-between containers on the deck shows a 10.4% average decrease in total wind load on the ship. Modeling a more slender ship hull while keeping the projected front and side area of the ship similar, yields an average decrease in total wind load of 5.9%. Blockage correction following the approach of the Engineering Sciences Date Unit underestimates the maximum lateral wind load up to 17.5%.
