In this study, a flat-plate channel configured with pyramidal protrusions are numerically analysed for the first time. Simulations of laminar single-phase fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics are developed using a finite-volume approach under steady-state condition. Pure water is selected as the coolant and its thermo-physical properties are modelled using a set of temperature-dependent functions. Different configurations of the channel, including a plain channel and a channel with nature-inspired protruded surfaces, are studied here for Reynolds numbers ranging from 135 to 1430. The effects of the protrusion shape, size and arrangement on the hydrothermal performance of a flat-plate channel are studied in details. The temperature of the upper and lower surfaces of the channel is kept constant during the simulations. It is observed that utilizing these configurations can boost the heat transfer up to 277.9% and amplify the pressure loss up to 179.4% with a respect to the plain channel. It is found that the overall efficiency of the channels with pyramidal protrusions is improved by 12.0â€“169.4% compared to the plain channel for the conditions studied here. Furthermore, the thermodynamic performance of the channel is investigated in terms of entropy generation and it is found that equipping the channels with pyramidal protrusions leads to lower irreversibility in the system.
