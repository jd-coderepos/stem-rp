Effective data visualisation is a key part of the scientific process with complex geometric datasets. It is the bridge between the quantitative content of the data and human intuition. Immersion in virtual reality (VR) provides benefits beyond the traditional “desktop” visualization tools and it leads to a demonstrably better perception of dataspace geometry, more intuitive data understanding, and a better retention of the perceived relationships in the data. VR has a great potential for fusion research and in the analysis of its complex physics-based datasets. The work presented in this paper is one of the applications that have been implemented at UKAEA which combines shutdown dose calculations with a virtual reality model of the Joint European Tokamak (JET) in a new code called VORTEX (Virtual Operator RadiaTion EXposure). The shutdown dose calculations were performed for various time steps during the JET DTE2 campaign using the UKAEA code MCR2S which links MCNP and FISPACT-II using the rigorous two step method. The 3 Dimensional dose and activation data created by MCR2S is integrated into the game engine Unity using C# routines to create VORTEX. A virtual reality model has been created from JET CAD data combined with the 3 dimensional radiation and activation data to create of virtual model of the radiological environment after the DTE2 campaign. This model enables more precise planning of operational procedures by having the operator/planner walk around the virtual environment using a virtual reality headset such as the Oculus rift or the HTC vive.
