In Raman thermometry, several assumptions are made to model the heat conduction and to extract the thermal conductivity of the samples from the measured data. In this work, the heat conduction in bulk and mesa-like samples was investigated by numerical simulation and measured by the temperature-induced Raman shift method, to study the range of applicability of these assumptions. The effects of light penetration depth and finite sample size on the accuracy of the thermal conductivity determination were investigated by comparing the results of the finite element method with the usual analytical approximation for bulk samples. We found that the assumptions used in the analytical model can be applied to extract the thermal conductivity in solids if the following conditions are fulfilled: the ratio of light penetration depth to laser spot radius is smaller than 0.5, the ratio of spot radius to sample thickness is smaller than 0.1, and the ratio of spot radius to sample half width is smaller than 0.01.
