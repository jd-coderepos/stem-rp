A stochastic cure simulation methodology is developed and implemented to investigate the influence of cure kinetics uncertainty due to different initial resin state on the process of cure. The simulation addresses heat transfer effects and allows quantification of uncertainty in temperature overshoot during the cure. Differential Scanning Calorimetry was used to characterise cure kinetics variability of a commercial epoxy resin used in aerospace applications. It was found that cure kinetics uncertainty is associated with variations in the initial degree of cure, activation energy and reaction order. A cure simulation model was coupled with conventional Monte Carlo and an implementation of the Probabilistic Collocation Method. Both simulation schemes are capable of capturing variability propagation, with the collocation method presenting benefits in terms of computational cost against the Monte Carlo scheme with comparable accuracy. Simulation of the cure of a carbon fibreâ€“epoxy panel shows that cure kinetics uncertainty can cause considerable variability in the process outcome with a coefficient of variation in temperature overshoot of about 30%.
