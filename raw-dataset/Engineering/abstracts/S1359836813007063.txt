With the growing interest to use composite materials and honeycomb sandwich panels in industrial fields, much attention is devoted to the development of non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques for the detection and evaluation of defects. In this work, scanning pulsed eddy current (PEC) was investigated and two features, representing the magnetic field intensity and conductivity, were used to characterise the different types of defects in carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) laminates and honeycomb sandwich panels. The experimental results show that the low energy impact from 4J to 12J, conductive and non-conductive insert defects can be effectively detected and evaluated using the proposed methods. The effectiveness was verified and the advantages of scanning PEC were addressed through comparative studies with flash thermography and shearography.
