1H NMR has been used to characterise white Portland cement paste incorporating 10wt.% of silica fume. Samples were measured sealed throughout the hydration without sample drying. Paste compositions and C–S–H characteristics are calculated based on 1H NMR signal intensities and relaxation analysis. The results are compared with a similar study of plain white cement paste. While the presence of silica fume has little influence on C–S–H densities, the chemical composition is impacted. After 28days of sealed hydration, the Ca/(Si+Al) ratio of the C–S–H is 1.33 and the H2O/(Si+Al) ratio is 1.10 when 10% of silica fume is added to the white cement. A densification of the C–S–H with time is observed. There are no major changes in capillary, C–S–H gel and interlayer pore sizes for the paste containing silica fume compared to the plain white cement paste. However, the gel/interlayer water ratio increases in the silica fume blend.
