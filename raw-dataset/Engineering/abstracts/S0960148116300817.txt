A non-linear programming model was developed to maximize the economic profit from an anaerobic co-digester. The model consists of a combination of technical and economic equations, linked through the biogas production variable. Five scenarios were simulated. These differed with regard to substrate inlet mass flow rate, organic loading rate and hydraulic retention time. The impact on biogas production was investigated and an economic analysis was undertaken based on the concepts of profitability and Net Present Value. The model results indicate that varying the substrate inlet mass flow rate and organic loading rate could have a positive impact on the profitability of co-digesters in Flanders. This can be achieved either by increasing the interval time between feedstock input, or by feeding individual streams of feedstock separately into the system, while at the same time reducing the hydraulic retention time.
