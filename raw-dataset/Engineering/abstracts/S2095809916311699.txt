Starting with the Ertan arch dam (240m high, 3300MW) in 2000, China successfully built a total of seven ultra-high arch dams over 200m tall by the end of 2014. Among these, the Jinping I (305m), Xiaowan (294.5m), and Xiluodu (285.5m) arch dams have reached the 300m height level (i.e., near or over 300m), making them the tallest arch dams in the world. The design and construction of these 300m ultra-high arch dams posed significant challenges, due to high water pressures, high seismic design criteria, and complex geological conditions. The engineering team successfully tackled these challenges and made critical breakthroughs, especially in the area of safety control. In this paper, the author summarizes various key technological aspects involved in the design and construction of 300m ultra-high arch dams, including the strength and stability of foundation rock, excavation of the dam base and surface treatment, dam shape optimization, safety design guidelines, seismic analysis and design, treatment of a complex foundation, concrete temperature control, and crack prevention. The experience gained from these projects should be valuable for future practitioners.
