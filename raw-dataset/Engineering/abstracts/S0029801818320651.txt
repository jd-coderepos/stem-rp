This paper presents a method for Real-Time Hybrid Model testing (ReaTHM testing) of ocean structures. ReaTHM testing is an extension to traditional hydrodynamic model-scale testing, where the system under study is partitioned into physical and numerical substructures. The physical and numerical subsystems are connected in real-time through a control system. Based on experience with various ReaTHM tests, a general method for ReaTHM testing of ocean structures has been proposed. An experimental case study was carried out to illustrate the proposed method. The study was conducted in a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic laboratory, where a physical cylindrical buoy was placed in a still-water basin. Horizontal mooring loads from a numerical mooring system, which were modelled using the nonlinear finite element software RIFLEX were actuated onto the physical substructure. System performance was verified through comparison with a physical horizontal mooring system consisting of physical springs.
