A meso-scale modelling framework is proposed to simulate the 3D woven fibre architectures and the mechanical performance of the composite T-joints, subjected to quasi-static tensile pull-off loading. The proposed method starts with building the realistic reinforcement geometries of the 3D woven T-joints at the mesoscale, of which the modelling strategy is applicable for other types of geometries with weave variations at the T-joint junction. Damage modelling incorporates both interface and constituent material damage, in conjunction with a continuum damage mechanics approach to account for the progressive failure behaviour. With a voxel based cohesive zone model, the proposed method is able to model mode I delamination based on the voxel mesh technique, which has advantages in meshing. Predicted results are in good agreement with experimental data beyond initial failure, in terms of load-displacement responses, failure events, damage initiation and propagation. The significant effect of fibre architecture variations on mechanical behaviour is successfully predicted through this modelling method without any further correlation of input parameters in damage model. This predictive method will facilitate the design and optimisation of 3D woven T-joint preforms.
