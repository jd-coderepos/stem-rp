The Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) breeder blanket is being developed as part of the European Fusion Programme. Part of the programme is to investigate blanket designs relevant for future demonstration fusion power plants. This paper presents neutronics analyses of the HCPB with an alternative neutron multiplier, Be12Ti which is incorporated into the design, replacing the current Be multiplier. A parameter study was performed for a range of geometries to identify the optimal heights of the lithium ceramic and neutron multiplier pebble beds. Automated creation of CAD models followed by conversion to constructive solid geometry (CSG) and unstructured mesh (UM) geometry allows the models to be useful for both neutronics simulations and engineering simulations. In this neutronics study simulations were performed using MCNP 6.1 to find the tritium breeding ratio, energy multiplication and the volumetric heat loads of different blanket designs. Combinations of geometry parameters and material choices that resulted in adequate TBR values were identified and will be further investigated with automated engineering simulations. This paper provides insight, supported by neutronics analysis, on the validity of the design and comments on some of the potential advantages and disadvantages of using Be12Ti in the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) breeder blanket. Blankets with Be12Ti neutron multiplier were found to produce less tritium but higher energy multiplication when compared to blankets with Be neutron multiplier.
