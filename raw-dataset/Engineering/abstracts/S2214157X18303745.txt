Iraq is suffering from kerosene surplus in the summer because kerosene consumption is significantly reduced. This product contains less sulphur than diesel, and it gains viscous and lubrication properties similar to those of diesel when mixed with a small percentage of biodiesel. The possibility of using biokerosene as a fuel instead of conventional Iraqi diesel was investigated. The fuel consumption was relatively increased by 5.56% and 5.19% when the studied biokerosene KB10 and KB20 blends were used while the engine's exhaust-gas temperatures and thermal efficiency were decreased. The biokerosene blends KB10 and KB20 also emitted lower concentrations of particulate matter (22.4%, and 25.63%), hydrocarbon (7.74%, and 21.93%), and carbon monoxide (15%, and 20.31%) compared to diesel at small or medium engine loads. Nitrogen oxide concentrations increased by (2.11% and 4.57%) with KB10 and KB20, while the engine noise measurements were lower than those from diesel by (1.51% and 3.57%) for all tested engine-load ranges. The PMâ€“NOx trade-off for biokerosene was the best among all tested blends.
