This numerical study is aimed at investigating the convective heat transfer and flow fluid inside a horizontal circular tube in the fully-developed laminar flow regime under the constant wall temperature boundary condition,, is commonly called the Graetz Problem that our goal is to get the steady temperature distribution in the fluid. The complexity of the partial differential equation that describes the temperature field with the associated linear or nonlinear boundary conditions is simplified by means of numerical methods using current computational tools. The simplified energy equation is solved numerically by the orthogonal collocation method followed by the finite difference method (Crank–Nicholson method).The calculations were effected through a FORTRAN computer program and the results show that orthogonal collocation method giving better results than Crank–Nicholson method.
