This article offers a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of the causes of thermal hardening in FCC Al and BCC Fe at high strain rates, with the aim to shed light on important mechanisms governing deformation and failures in materials subjected to shocks and impacts at very high strain rates. Experimental evidence regarding the temperature dependence of the dynamic yield point of FCC Al and BCC Fe shock loaded at 10 7 s−1 is provided. The dynamic yield point of Al increases with temperature in the range 125K–795K; for the same loading and temperate range, the dynamic yield point of BCC Fe remains largely insensitive. A Multiscale Discrete Dislocation Plasticity (MDDP) model of both Fe and Al is developed, leading to good agreement with experiments. The importance of the Peierls barrier in Fe is highlighted, showing it is largely responsible for the temperature insensitivity in BCC metals. The relevance of the mobility of edge components in determining the plastic response of both FCC Al and BCC Fe at different temperatures is discussed, which leads to developing a mechanistic explanation of the underlying mechanisms leading to the experimental behaviour using Dynamic Discrete Dislocation Plasticity (D3P). It is shown that the main contributing factor to temperature evolution of the dynamic yield point is not the mobility of dislocations, but the temperature variation of the shear modulus, the decrease of which is correlated to the experimental behaviour observed for both FCC Al and BCC Fe.
