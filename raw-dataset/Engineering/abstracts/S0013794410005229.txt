The paper concerns 3-D fracture dynamic problems for elastic bimaterials with cracks located at the bonding interface under the time-harmonic loading. The problem for a penny-shaped interface crack under normally incident tension–compression wave is solved taking the crack’s closure into account. The dynamic stress intensity factors are computed as functions of the loading frequency and compared with those obtained neglecting the crack’s closure.
