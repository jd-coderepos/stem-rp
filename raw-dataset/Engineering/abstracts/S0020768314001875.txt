Thin membranes are used in the spacecraft industry as extremely lightweight structural components. They need to be stiffened, usually by applying discrete forces, and this increases their susceptibility to wrinkling in regions where high tensile stresses develop. We consider a regular polygonal membrane uniformly loaded at its corners by equal forces and we prevent wrinkle formation by trimming the edges of the polygon into very gentle curves. We confirm this performance through simple physical experiments using Kapton, a typical membrane material and, using computational analysis, we show how the distribution of compressive stresses, responsible for causing wrinkles, dissipates following trimming. Finally, we accurately predict the required level of trimming for any number of sides of polygon using a simple, linear model, which invokes a plate-bending analogy.
