We detect changes in the optical properties of a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS), ZnO, in a multi-thin-film matrix with platinum in the presence of the hydrocarbon gas methane. A limit of detection of 2% by volume with concentrations from 0 to 10% and maximum resolution of 0.15% with concentrations ranging from 30% to 80% at room temperature are demonstrated along with a selective chemical response to methane over carbon dioxide and the other alkane gases. The device yields the equivalent maximum bulk refractive index spectral sensitivity of 1.8Ã—105 nm/RIU. This is the first time that the optical properties of MOS have been monitored to detect the presence of a specific gas. This single observation is a significant result, as MOS have a potentially large number of target gases, thus offering a new paradigm for gas sensing using MOSs.
