Unique word-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (UW-OFDM) is a novel signaling concept where the guard interval is implemented as a deterministic sequence, the so-called unique word. The UW is generated by introducing a certain level of redundancy in the frequency domain. Different data estimation strategies and the favourable bit error ratio (BER) performance of UW-OFDM, as well as comparisons to competing concepts have already extensively been discussed in previous papers. This work focuses on the different possibilities on how to generate UW-OFDM signals. The optimality of the two-step over the direct approach in systematic UW-OFDM is proved analytically, we present a heuristic algorithm that allows a fast numerical optimization of the redundant subcarrier positions, and we show that our original intuitive approach of spreading the redundant subcarriers in systematically encoded UW-OFDM by minimizing the mean redundant energy is practically also optimum w.r.t. transceiver based cost functions. Finally, we derive closed form approximations of the statistical symbol distributions on individual subcarriers as well as the redundant energy distribution and compare them with numerically found results.
