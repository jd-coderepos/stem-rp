It is challenging to gain insight of a Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) system dynamic behaviour under various operation conditions due to its complexity with mixed mechanical, thermal, chemical and electrical processes in one. Although a number of studies are reported on CAES steady state and dynamic modelling to reveal its characteristics, few studies have been reported in whole CAES system dynamic modelling involving a radial turbine. This paper explores a new method to analyse the transient performance of the radial turbine while it is integrated with whole low temperature Adiabatic-CAES system. The proposed modelling method approximates the average air flow within single stator/rotor stage. By applying the principle of energy and torque balance on the transmission shaft, the dynamic speed-torque characteristics of the turbine is obtained with a “quasi dynamic iterative searching” process. The model is then integrated to a simulation platform, which is created to synchronise the wide range of time scale dynamic responses including heat transfer, mechanical and electrical energy conversion processes. As every component of the low temperature adiabatic CAES system is built on its fundamental physical and engineering principles, the model is capable of revealing the system transient characteristics. Based on the model, various simulation studies are conducted and the results are compared with the operation data from the literature. It provides a valuable tool for preliminary design of a radial turbine to test its suitability in full and partial load operation conditions, and analyse its transient behaviours.
