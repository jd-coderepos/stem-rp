This work was carried out to predict both the monthly and yearly optimum tilt angle for the photovoltaic cells that are located in Baghdad (latitude 33°20′), Diyala (33°14′), and Tikrit (34°35′). These Iraqi cities were selected based on their geographical location. Mathematical models were used and programmed by engineering equation solver, EES, to find the optimum tilt angle, depending on the maximum solar power intensity obtained; the tilt angle varied within a range from 0° to 90°. The results show that the optimum tilt angle for all these cities is the same for 31°. The monthly tilt angle was different from one month to another.
