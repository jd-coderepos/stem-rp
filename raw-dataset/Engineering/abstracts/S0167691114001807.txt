Recently, Mao (2013) discusses the mean-square exponential stabilization of continuous-time hybrid stochastic differential equations by feedback controls based on discrete-time state observations. Mao (2013) also obtains an upper bound on the duration τ between two consecutive state observations. However, it is due to the general technique used there that the bound on τ is not very sharp. In this paper, we will consider a couple of important classes of hybrid SDEs. Making full use of their special features, we will be able to establish a better bound on τ . Our new theory enables us to observe the system state less frequently (so costs less) but still to be able to design the feedback control based on the discrete-time state observations to stabilize the given hybrid SDEs in the sense of mean-square exponential stability.
