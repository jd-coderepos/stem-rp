Marble industry produces large amount of waste during mining and processing stages. This waste is dumped on to open land which creates a lot of environmental problems. The main objective of this study was utilization of marble waste as a replacement for conventional natural coarse aggregate in concrete. Experimental investigations were carried out to examine the feasibility of use of marble waste as a coarse aggregate in concrete. Conventional natural coarse aggregate was replaced by marble aggregate in different percentages 0–100% by weight. The concrete formulations were prepared with a constant water–cement ratio 0.60. It was observed that workability of concrete mixes containing marble aggregate was 14% more than that of control concrete. The average compressive strength of all the concrete mixes containing marble aggregate increased by 40% and 18% at 7 and 28 days, respectively.
