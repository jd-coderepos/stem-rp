The extracellular matrix (ECM) performs many critical functions, one of which is to provide structural and mechanical integrity, and many of the constituent proteins have clear mechanical roles. The composition and structural characteristics of the ECM are widely variable among different tissues, suiting diverse functional needs. In diseased tissues, particularly solid tumors, the ECM is complex and influences disease progression. Cancer and stromal cells can significantly influence the matrix composition and structure and thus the mechanical properties of the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we describe the interactions that give rise to the structural heterogeneity of the ECM and present the techniques that are widely employed to measure ECM properties and remodeling dynamics. Furthermore, we review the tools for measuring the distinct nature of cellâ€“ECM interactions within the TME.
