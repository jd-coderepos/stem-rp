The presented work addresses the investigation of the heat loss of a confined turbulent jet flame in a lab-scale combustor using a conjugate-heat transfer approach and large-eddy simulation. The analysis includes the assessment of the principal mechanisms of heat transfer in this combustion chamber: radiation, convection and conduction of heat over walls. A staggered approach is used to couple the reactive flow field to the heat conduction through the solid and both domains are solved using two implementations of the same code. Numerical results are compared against experimental data and an assessment of thermal boundary conditions to improve the prediction of the reactive flow field is given.
