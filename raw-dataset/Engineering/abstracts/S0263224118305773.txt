Due to the high resolution of modern measurement devices, point clouds are usually characterized by a large amount of data. Handling such large amount of data requires long processing time. A mesh decimation is usually performed to reduce the number of points in order to maintain the critical points able to describe the features of the mesh. The decimation process may produce anisotropic meshes. In this paper the estimation of some areal roughness parameters as a function of the number of the decimated points and the estimation of the form surface is investigated.
