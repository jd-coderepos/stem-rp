We use the energy method to find regions of stability for a horizontal layer of a Darcy porous medium with an exothermic reaction on the lower layer. The results are compared to the linear instability results for this model found by Scott and Straughan [16]. It is shown that there is a region in which sub-critical instabilities may occur, but for small Lewis numbers, 0 < Le < 10 , the non-linear stability boundary is reasonably close to the linear instability boundary. The effect of varying the parameters of the reaction on the stability curve is discussed.
