In this study, the k-Îµ turbulence model with enhanced wall function using ANSYS commercial software is used for studying the effect of convergent/divergent sections on the heat transfer of nanofluids in two different cases. In first case, a venturi is modeled with different nanoparticles (SiO2, Al2O3 and CuO) and in second case, a wavy tube with different sinusoidal wall functions (sin(x/2), sin(x) and sin (2x)) is considered. Results of first case revealed that SiO2-water had the most surface Nusselt number among the other nanofluids and outcomes of second case confirmed that when the wave length is smaller (for sin (2x)) the temperatures near the walls increased and consequently the surface Nusselt number in peak areas are greater among other tested wall functions.
