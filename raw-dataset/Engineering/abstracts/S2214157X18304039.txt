The present paper examines the analytical approach of a second grade fluid flow along a stretching cylinder and the Soret and Dufour effects is also investigated on the problem. The flow is subjected to thermal radiation. A system of non-linear equations has been extracted using the mathematical modeling of a second grade fluid flow in a cylindrical coordinate system. Homotopy analysis method (HAM) was implemented to solve this problem which an excellent agreement between this method and the numerical approach was observed in the results. The effect of the following physical parameters on the velocity, temperature and concentration profiles has been investigated in this paper; viscoelastic parameter (We), curvature parameter Î³ , Dufour parameter (Du), Soret parameter (Sr), temperature exponent (n), effective Prandtl number Pr eff and Schmidt number (Sc), etc. moreover, the drag coefficient on surface along with heat and mass transfer rate are also investigated and presented in various tables. For instance, it is predicted that Simultaneous variations of Du and Sr has an inverse relation for heat and mass transfer rate. In this case increasing Du and decreasing Sr would cause a decrease in heat transfer rate along with an increase in mass transfer rate.
