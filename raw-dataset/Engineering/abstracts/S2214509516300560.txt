This work studied the effect of rolling process parameters at different rolling strain rates, % total deformations and finish rolling temperatures on the mechanical properties of hot-rolled St60Mn steel. The rolling process parameters studied included finish rolling temperature, % total deformation and rolling strain rates. The results were compared with existing literature on rolling carbon steels. The tensile strength, yield strength, hardness, young’s modulus of elasticity, toughness, bendability, % enlongation and % reduction in area of the hot-rolled product were obtained. The results showed that the rolling process parameters remarkably influenced the mechanical properties of St60Mn steel. The trend in property change was dictated by rolling strain rate, % total deformation and finish rolling temperature. It was concluded that increasing the rolling strain rate from 6.02851×103s-' to 6.10388×103s-', using % total deformations of 99% and finish rolling temperature of 958°C enhanced the mechanical properties of St60Mn steel.
