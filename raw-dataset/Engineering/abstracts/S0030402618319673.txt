The authors describe the optimal pumping condition and output considering the media fracture and thermal lens effect at a 2 at.% ceramic Nd:YAG laser. The overall output characteristics according to a spot diameter of pump light, output degradation due to thermal lens effect, and critical pump power that generates a media fracture were analyzed. The analysis results showed that the optimal pumping conditions were 170 Î¼m of spot diameter and 11.9 W of maximum pump power, at which output efficiency of 40.3% and output power of 4.8 W could be obtained without media fracture. The finite element analysis on the ceramic Nd:YAG laser was conducted, and the analysis results showed that the stress fracture safety factor was 2.4.
