Density-graded metallic foam projectiles are proposed for shock loading simulation, with special focus placed upon designing pressure pulses having specific shapes. Experiments are performed to explore the potential of density-graded foam projectiles in generating shock loadings of various pulse shapes. Subsequently, three-dimensional Voronoi foam models with varying gradient profiles along the length direction are constructed for finite element (FE) simulations, which are validated against the experimental data. Then, FE simulations of density-graded foam projectiles impacting a stationary rigid wall are conducted to quantify the effect of density gradient on the shape of the pressure pulse generated and explore the physical mechanisms underlying such effect. It is demonstrated that density gradient affects significantly local crushing stress and local density within the shock front when it propagates from the impact end to the other end of the foam projectile. Inspired by the FE simulation results and the classical Taylor impact model, one-dimensional theoretical model for density-graded foam projectiles is developed to predict the contact force between the projectile and the fixed rigid wall. Finally, the theoretical model is employed to determine the geometry, density gradient, and firing velocity of foam projectiles needed to generate shock loadings with prescribed pulse shapes.
