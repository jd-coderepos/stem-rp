Thin, initially-flat plates can deform inextensionally and elastically during large out-of-plane deformations. This paper revisits an analytical method for describing the developable shapes of displaced plate, in order to quantify and validate its effectiveness. Results from practical experiments and finite element analysis are compared to theoretical predictions from well-known examples, and excellent correlations are obtained.
