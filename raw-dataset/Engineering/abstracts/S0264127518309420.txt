For industrial applications such as construction, sports or aviation the interest in novel 3D woven structures grows. Current production routes have typical downsides such as low production speed, need for dedicated looms for weaving one specific fabric type or time consuming modifications to the weaving loom. In contrast, the present research shows the production of different 3D woven fabrics in one run, at industrial speed on a weaving loom with minor adaptations. A wide range of 3D woven fabrics with integrated prismatic shaped cavities is produced. Moreover, switching from one fabric type to another is fast and feasible using the same loom. These novel 3D fabrics can be divided in three categories depending on the internal connection structure, i.e. hexagonal (type I), rectangular (type II) or X-shaped (type III). All novel weaving patterns are developed for high tenacity (HT) polyester and are characterised with tensile tests, showing promising results. In addition several structures based on aramid and glass yarns are produced, aiming towards lightweight composite materials. The high ductility of the HT-polyester fabrics is of interest for example in shock absorbing applications. Two applications, reinforced concrete beams and lightweight foam composite panels, are illustrated and indeed show excellent ductile properties.
