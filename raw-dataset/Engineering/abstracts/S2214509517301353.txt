This paper presents a comparison between two standards, namely NF EN 1991-1-4/A1 (October 2010) of Eurocode 1 and NV65 (DTU P06-002) (February 2009), that estimate wind loads on steel structures. For that purpose, a typical steel hanger was designed and analysed using both standards. Five different heights for the designed hanger were considered going from five to 25 m with an increment of 5 m. The paper shows all obtained curves for the calculated internal forces (axial, shear, and bending moment) on the hanger elements for all studied cases when using both standards.
