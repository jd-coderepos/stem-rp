An FE model of the solution heat treatment, forming and in-die quenching (HFQ) process was developed. Good correlation with a deviation of less than 5% was achieved between the thickness distribution of the simulated and experimentally formed parts, verifying the model. Subsequently, the model was able to provide a more detailed understanding of the HFQ process, and was used to study the effects of forming temperature and speed on the thickness distribution of the HFQ formed part. It was found that a higher forming speed is beneficial for HFQ forming, as it led to less thinning and improved thickness homogeneity.
