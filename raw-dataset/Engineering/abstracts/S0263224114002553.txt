We present an electromagnetic measurement system for monitoring of the effective permittivity in closed metal vessels, which are commonly used in the process industry. The measurement system exploits the process vessel as a microwave cavity resonator and the relative change in its complex resonance frequencies is related to the complex effective permittivity inside the vessel. Also, thermal expansion of the process vessel is taken into account and we compensate for its influence on the resonance frequencies by means of a priori information derived from a set of temperature measurements. The sensitivities, that relate the process state to the measured resonance frequencies, are computed by means of a detailed finite element model. The usefulness of the proposed measurement system is successfully demonstrated for a pharmaceutical fluidized-bed process, where the water and solid contents inside the process vessel is of interest.
