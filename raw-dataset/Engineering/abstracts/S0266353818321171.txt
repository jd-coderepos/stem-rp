This study presents a new process for producing nanocomposite powders for use in various manufacturing processes such as laser sintering or dry powder impregnation techniques for thermoplastic composites manufacture. Polyetherimide (PEI) was used as a polymeric coating/shell to encapsulate nanoparticles on the surface of poly ether ether ketone (PEEK) particles, which were used as a core matrix. Nanoparticles with different morphologies, known to enhance thermal and electrical performance of polymers: 2D graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and inorganic fullerene-like tungsten disulfide (IF-WS2) in different concentrations (0.1, 1, and 5 wt%) were incorporated in the shell structures. The coated powders had approximately the same particle size distribution as the uncoated, plain powders, which is an indication that the shell was in nm size and the coating process did not affect the overall size of the particles. Furthermore, the core-shell particles exhibit a smoother surface and an improved flowability after coating. The Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images of the nanocomposite particles cross-section area confirmed the formation of core-shell structure, and the presence of the nanoparticles embedded into the shell layer. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed a homogeneous distribution of nanoparticles within the coating layer at lower nanoparticle concentrations (0.1 and 1 wt%).
