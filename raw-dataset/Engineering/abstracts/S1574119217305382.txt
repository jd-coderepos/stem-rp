The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) application within the health- and wellbeing domain enables individuals to monitor their health. Acquired data can be used privately, contribute to clinical databases, or for research. The amount of health and wellbeing tracking devices introduces complexity in data aggregation and scattered overviews. Few services exist to aggregate health data. Current services raise privacy concerns. Consume is a service for aggregating authentication and authorisation for Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Consume aims at research and allows to add existing and custom APIs on-the-fly without restarting services.
