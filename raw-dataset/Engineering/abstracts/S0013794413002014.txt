A novel lattice model is proposed for linking experimentally measured porosity of concrete to damage evolution and the emergent macroscopic behaviour. Pore sizes are resolved by X-ray CT and distributed at lattice bonds. The mechanical behaviour of bonds is elastic-brittle with failure criterion dependent on local forces and pore sizes. Bond failures provide the only non-linear effect on the macroscopic response. Results are compared to several experimental load cases. They show good agreement of stressâ€“strain response at lower stress levels and expected differences at peak stresses. The framework allows for future development of models with plasticity and time-dependent effects.
