The aim of this work is not only to give an up-to-date review of perishable inventory models, but also of the joint key topics of publications from January 2012 until December 2015 in the research area of deteriorating inventory models. The advantage of this review is the ability to quickly find papers according to given key topics. Methodically, this paper is based on the literature review of Bakker et al. (2012). However, we slightly modify the classification of inventory models of perishable goods in our work, and extend the existing key topics.
