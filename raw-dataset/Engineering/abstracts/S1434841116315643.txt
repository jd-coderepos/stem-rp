This paper proves a new approach for rapid prototyping of radio antennas through 3D printing and chemical metallization. For this purpose, a standard metal pyramidal horn prototype is compared with its 3D printed replica. Three different 3D polymer printers are tested. The printed samples are assessed nondestructively by an X-ray Industrial Computed Tomography (CT) scanner, and then metalized via chemical deposition and chemical-electrochemical deposition. Copper with two different layer thicknesses and nickel materials are deployed and verified as a metallization opportunity. Again the CT scanner, X-ray fluorescent analysis and nanoindentation technique were used to perform the metallization quality estimation. As a result, a qualitative polymer prototype was produced having weight of 13g – ten times lighter than the original. The prototype was successfully metalized and was able to be soldered. The radio-measurement comparison with the metal original for frequencies 14–18GHz showed no significant differences. Finally, a simple dynamometric test confirmed the bonding between the metal and the polymer. To the best of our knowledge this is the first known comprehensive analysis of the possibility to print 3D lightweight wideband polymer antenna prototypes with a stable chemical metallization and radio properties very close to the original at 14–18GHz.
