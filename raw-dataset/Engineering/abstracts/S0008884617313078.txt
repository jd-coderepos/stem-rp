Cementation of the secondary aqueous wastes from TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant is challenging due to the significant strontium content and radioactivity, leading to a potential risk of hydrogen gas generation via radiolysis of water content. The present study investigates the reduction of water content in calcium aluminate cement (CAC) with/out phosphate modification by a heat-treatment during the solidification. The reduction of water in the CAC was found restricted by the rapid formation of crystalline hydration phases, whereas the phosphate-modified system allowed the gradual reduction of water, achieving the reduction of 60% water content at 95 °C. Curing at 60–95 °C also eliminated the significant cracks found at 35 °C in the phosphate system. The possible difference in the amorphous products, NaCaPO4∙nH2O type at 35 °C and Ca(HPO4)∙xH2O type at 60–95 °C, may have contributed to the improvement in the microstructure together with the change in the pore size distribution.
