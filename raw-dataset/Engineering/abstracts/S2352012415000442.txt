Grouted connections have been extensively used in the oil and gas industry for decades, and more recently their application has been extended to the offshore wind industry. Unfortunately plain-pipe grouted connections for large-diameter monopile foundations have recently exhibited clear signs of insufficient axial capacity, resulting in slippage between the transition piece and monopile. Motivated by the emergence of such problems, this paper presents a critical review of the technical literature related to the experimental testing for grouted connections for offshore substructures, covering all the key material and design parameters that influence their capacity, including the confinement provided by pile and sleeve, surface finish, simultaneous bending action, connection length, dynamic loading, early-age cycling during grout curing, grout shrinkage, radial pre-stress and temperature. The review also focuses on the relevance of such parameters for offshore wind applications and addresses what needs to be considered to ensure that their design achieves the desired capacity, behaviour and efficiency.
