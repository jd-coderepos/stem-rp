This article introduces maintenance informatics dashboard design approach for visualising maintenance, repair and overhaul events on a timeline. This paper presents a proposed methodology for aggregate visualisation techniques and a 2D graphical plot method as well as a summary of events on a timeline. In this paper, these events are occurrences which are classified and categorised into levels. The occurrences are accumulated over time as historical information and represented in a visual format over a timeline based on an entity relationship diagram. The information modelling technique with respect to data visualisation is emphasised. The result is a single-page-view of maintenance activities. The maintenance activities of aircraft engines are visualised to ease the accessibility of getting accurate and relevant information for making better maintenance decision. The result can be used to gain insight of the root cause of the events from inception to end of life of the engine.
