Forced structural vibration and cutting tool inaccuracy have been identified to be the primary causes of surface defects in rotary wood planing. This paper presents the development of a control strategy used to compensate for the effects of both vibration and cutting tool inaccuracy on planed wood surface finish. The solution is based on active vibration control and real-time modification of the cutting tool trajectory using an optimal Linear Quadratic Gaussian tracking controller. A small-scale mechatronic wood planing machine, which has an actively controlled spindle unit, has been designed for practical investigation of the proposed technique. Experimental results show that the applied compensation increased the dynamic performance of the machine and the quality of the surface finish produced.
