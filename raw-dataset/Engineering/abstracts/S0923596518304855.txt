Holography is considered to be the ultimate display technology since it can account for all human visual cues such as stereopsis and eye focusing. Aside from hardware constraints for building holographic displays, there are still many research challenges regarding holographic signal processing that need to be tackled. In this overview, we delineate the steps needed to realize an end-to-end chain from digital content acquisition to display, involving the efficient generation, representation, coding and quality assessment of digital holograms. We discuss the current state-of-the-art and what hurdles remain to be taken to pave the way towards realistic visualization of dynamic holographic content.
