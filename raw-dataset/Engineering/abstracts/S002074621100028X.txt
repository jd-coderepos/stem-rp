A strongly non-linear dynamic problem of thermomechanics for multilayer beams is formulated based on the Kirchhoffâ€“Love hypotheses. In the case of harmonic loading, a simplified formulation is given using a single-frequency approximation and the concept of complex moduli to characterise the non-linear cyclic properties of the material. As an example, the problem of forced vibrations and dissipative heating of a roller-supported layered beam containing piezoactive layers is solved. Different aspects of thermal, mechanical and electric responses to the mechanical and electric excitations are addressed. Dissipative heating due to electromechanical losses in the three-layer beam with piezoelectric layers is studied. It is assumed that the structure fails if the temperature exceeds the Curie point for piezoceramics. Using this criterion, the fatigue life of the structure is estimated. Limitations of the approximate monoharmonic approach are also specified.
