The potential drop (PD) crack growth measurement technique is sensitive to strain accumulation which is often erroneously interpreted as crack extension. When testing ductile materials these errors can be significant, but in many cases the optimum method of minimising or suppressing them remains unknown because it is extremely difficult to measure them experimentally in isolation from other sources of error, such non-ideal crack morphology. In this work a novel method of assessing the influence of strain on PD, using a sequentially coupled structural-electrical finite element (FE) model, has been developed. By comparing the FE predictions with experimental data it has been demonstrated that the proposed FE technique is extremely effective at predicting trends in PD due to strain. It has been used to identify optimum PD configurations for compact tension, C(T), and single edge notched tension, SEN(T), fracture mechanics specimens and it has been demonstrated that the PD configuration often recommended for C(T) specimens can be subject to large errors due to strain accumulation. In addition, the FE technique has been employed to assess the significance of strain after the initiation of stable tearing for a monotonically loaded C(T) specimen. The proposed FE technique provides a powerful tool for optimising the measurement of crack initiation and growth in applications where large strains are present, e.g. J-R curve and creep crack growth testing.
