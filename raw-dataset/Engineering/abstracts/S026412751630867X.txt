The prediction of delamination onset is a challenging task in the design of thick tapered composite laminates, where multiple ply terminations (“drop-offs”) are present. This paper addresses the development of a global-local finite element-based design approach for tapered laminates, whereby layered Timoshenko beam models are employed to predict delamination initiation from individual drop-offs. This modelling strategy provides a fast and conservative method for evaluating the strength of tapered composite laminates. Parametric test cases are presented in order to validate the methodology and understand its limitations. Finally, the application of the tool to a relatively thick tapered composite test specimen comprising multiple ply-drops is demonstrated.
