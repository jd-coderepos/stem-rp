The tendency of ash particles to stick under high temperatures is dictated by the ash chemistry, particle physical properties, deposit surface properties and furnace operation conditions. A model has been developed in order to predict the particle sticking efficiency for fly ash deposition at high temperatures. The model incorporates the particle properties relevant to the ash chemistry, particle kinetic energy and furnace operation conditions and takes into consideration the partial sticking behaviour and the deposit layer. To test the model, the sticking behaviours of synthetic ash in a drop tube furnace are evaluated and the slagging formation from coal combustion in a down-fired furnace is modelled. Compared with the measurements, the proposed model presents reasonable prediction performance on the particle sticking behaviour and the ash deposition formation. Through a sensitivity analysis, furnace operation conditions (velocity and temperature), contact angle and particle size have been found to be the significant factors in controlling the sticking behaviours for the synthetic ash particles. The ash chemistry and furnace temperature dictate the wetting potential of the ash particles and the melting ability of the deposit surface; particle size and density not only control the particle kinetic energy, but also affect the particle temperature. The furnace velocity condition has been identified as being able to influence the selective deposition behaviour, where the maximum deposition efficiency moves to smaller particles when increasing the gas velocity. In addition, the thermophoresis effect on the arrival rate of the particles reduces with increasing the gas velocity. Further, increasing the melting degree of the deposit layer could greatly enhance the predicted deposition formation, in particular for the high furnace velocity condition.
