The influence of the averaging operator of nonlocal continuum damage models near specimen boundaries on the size effect on strength of quasibrittle materials is investigated. Two phenomenological approaches, namely standard rescaling and distance-based models, are considered. The numerical results are compared to data from three-point bending tests of notched and unnotched beams recently reported in the literature. It is shown that both approaches can reproduce the experiments well for one type of geometry with one set of input parameters. However, only the distance-based model provides a good agreement for both unnotched and notched beams with the same set of parameters.
