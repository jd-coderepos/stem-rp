Bulk thickness measurements were performed at elevated temperatures on magnetite coated low carbon steel pipe and aluminium samples, using a permanent magnet electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT). The design presented here exploits the non-contact nature of EMATs to allow continuous operation at elevated temperatures without physical coupling, sample preparation (in the form of oxide scale removal), or active cooling of the EMAT. A non-linear change in signal amplitude was recorded as the magnetite coated sample was heated in a furnace, whereas a steady decrease in amplitude was observed in aluminium. For a magnetite coated pipe sample, after a dwell time of 3h, a SNR of 33.4dB was measured at 450째C, whilst a SNR of 33.0dB was found at 25째C. No significant EMAT performance loss was observed after one month of continuous exposure to 450째C. EMAT-sample lift-off performance was investigated at elevated temperature on magnetite coated steel; a single-shot SNR of 31dB for 3.0mm lift-off was recorded at 450째C, highlighting the suitability of this design for scanning or continuous fixed point inspection at high temperature.
