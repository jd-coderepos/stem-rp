This paper deals with the numerical simulation of the honeycomb machining process taking into account the behaviour of Nomex® material and the effect of its cell structure. Using Hashin failure criterion, a single orthotropic layer model was developed to simulate the machining of honeycomb structure. To understand the effect of the cutting parameters on machinability of these materials, the interaction between a specific cutting tool geometry and the structure walls has been analyzed. The results of the 3D FE simulations developed for milling process of honeycomb materials show the evolution of cutting forces and surface quality generated during machining the Nomex® honeycomb.
