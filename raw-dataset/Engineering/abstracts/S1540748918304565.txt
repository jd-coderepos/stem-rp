The criterion used to define MILD combustion in non-premixed condition is analysed using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of MILD combustion of methane-diluted air established with internal exhaust gas recirculation. The simulations reveal multiple interacting reaction zones in MILD combustion which are extremely different from conventional combustion. Furthermore, DNS deduced S-curves highlight the role of chemically active species. Specifically, the temperature rise is accompanied with an increase in the scalar dissipation rate of mixture fraction, which is quite contrasting to the classical S-curve from the classical flame theories. This observation is explained on a physical basis.
