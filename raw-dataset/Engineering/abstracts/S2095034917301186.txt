ABSTRACT In the present work, we analyse the delamination problem under the combined dynamic load. We show the effect of background harmonic vibrations on critical amplitudes of the principal force pulse. The effect is demonstrated on the simple model of a string on an elastic foundation and the fracture phenomenon is predicted by the incubation time criterion. The results state the possibility of considerable decrease in threshold amplitude by a proper choice of the frequency of a background excitation.
