This study is inspired by a revival of traditional stuccoes, plasterwork and recent research on plastering. It includes descriptions of old and new material production techniques with an expected long service life to minimize waste production. A detailed review of the stuccoes and plasters from historical construction treatises was carried out. Their constituents, as well as their functions were studied, and an equivalent eco-mortar was formulated. XRD, EDS, MIP, BET and XRF analysis of the mortars components provided their mineralogical, microstructure and chemical characterization. Petrographic analysis supplied data on the mortars voids. The effect of waste marble and limestone dust on physic-mechanical properties of the eco-mortar was studied in order to find better solutions for restoration interventions. The elastic modulus and compressive and flexural strength of each plaster layer was correlated with the cracking prevention capacity of the mortar. The coefficient of water absorption was estimated in order to study the water exchange behavior between the last two layers of stuccoes and plasters. Furthermore, their behavior with respect to humidity was studied.
