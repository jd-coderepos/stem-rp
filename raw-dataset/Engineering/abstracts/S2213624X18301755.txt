This paper presents the latest achievements of TEMA (Transport Technology and Mobility Assessment) platform, designed to harness the potential of big data to support road transport policies in Europe. The platform relies on datasets of real world driving and mobility patterns collected by means of navigation systems and it is developed by the EC Joint Research Centre since 2012. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of the platform in assessing real world emissions from conventional fuel vehicles and exploring the impact of the deployment of electrified vehicles in terms of usability, technology potential, energy requirements and infrastructural design. These last studies have been carried out on two pilot regions, i.e. the Italian provinces of Modena and Florence, whilst this article presents the earliest results achieved enlarging the study to a European-wide scale. To this purpose, results from additional fourteen new regions are presented, i.e. Amsterdam (NL), Brussels (BE), Luxembourg (LU), Paris (FR), Lisbon (PT), Krefeld (DE), Warsaw (PL), Bratislava (SK), Vienna (AT), Ljubljana (SI), Zagreb (HR), Budapest (HU), Sofia (BG), Athens (GR). The complete dataset accounts for approximately 2.57 billion records, 139 million driven kilometres and 632,186 monitored vehicles, being one among the most extensive driving datasets ever processed for policy support studies. This work constitutes the first attempt for initiating a continental scale study of driving behaviour in Europe, with the aim of showing how the proposed approach allows for unprecedented opportunities to shape the future of road transport.
