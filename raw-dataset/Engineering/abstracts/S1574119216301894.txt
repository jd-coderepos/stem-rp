The visual lifelogging activity enables a user, the lifelogger, to passively capture images from a first-person perspective and ultimately create a visual diary encoding every possible aspect of her life with unprecedented details. In recent years, it has gained popularities among different groups of users. However, the possibility of ubiquitous presence of lifelogging devices specifically in private spheres has raised serious concerns with respect to personal privacy. In this article, we have presented a thorough discussion of privacy with respect to visual lifelogging. We have re-adjusted the existing definition of lifelogging to reflect different aspects of privacy and introduced a first-ever privacy threat model identifying several threats with respect to visual lifelogging. We have also shown how the existing privacy guidelines and approaches are inadequate to mitigate the identified threats. Finally, we have outlined a set of requirements and guidelines that can be used to mitigate the identified threats while designing and developing a privacy-preserving framework for visual lifelogging.
