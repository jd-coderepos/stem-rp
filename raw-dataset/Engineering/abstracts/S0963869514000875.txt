The frequency dependent directivity of the periodic permanent magnet transducer is used to extract information about the position of any discontinuities present in a sample. Two approaches are used: narrowband excitation and broadband pulsed generation. Simultaneous narrowband excitation, with the appropriate frequency, can be used to steer the ultrasound to a particular angle. Broadband excitation emits a wavefront that extends over a large range of angles, with the frequency of the wavefront varying smoothly as a function of angle. Using these two approaches, two-dimensional maps of any defects present in the sample can be obtained.
