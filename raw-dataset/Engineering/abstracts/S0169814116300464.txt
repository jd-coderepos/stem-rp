Cloud manufacturing adopts a cloud computing paradigm as the basis for delivering shared, on-demand manufacturing services. The result is customer-centric supply chains that can be configured for cost, quality, speed and customisation. While the technical capabilities required for cloud manufacturing are a current focus, there are many emerging questions relating to the impact, both positive and negative, on the people consuming or supporting cloud manufacturing services. Human factors can have a pivotal role in enabling the success and adoption of cloud manufacturing, while ensuring the safety, well-being and optimum user experience of those involved in a cloud manufacturing environment. This paper presents these issues, structured around groups of users (service providers, application providers and consumers). We also consider the issues of collaboration that are likely to arise from the manufacturing cloud. From this analysis we discuss the central role of human factors as an enabler of cloud manufacturing, and the opportunities that emerge.
