This study aims to develop a methodology for evaluating the degradation of concrete structures subjected to aggressive environments containing chloride ions based on the use of monitoring systems with sensors permanently installed within the structures. Assays were performed on specimens subjected to controlled media in the laboratory. Measurements of linear polarization resistance (LPR), ionic resistivity of the concrete and corrosion potential of embedded rebars and of chloride content in the concrete probes were made. Analysis of the results based on Evans diagrams, allowed the development of a model based on the simultaneous monitoring over time of the corrosion potential of the steel reinforcement and its LPR could the identification of the various phases of the degradation process of concrete structures, particularly in the initiation phase.
