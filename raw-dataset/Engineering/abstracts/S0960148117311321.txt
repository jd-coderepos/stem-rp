Cross-ventilation using rooftop wind-catchers is very complex as it is influenced by a wide range of interrelated factors including aerodynamic characteristics of the wind catcher, approach-flow conditions and building geometry. Earlier studies on wind-driven cross-ventilation in buildings have shown the significant impact of the geometry and position of openings on the flow and ventilation performance. However, this has not yet been investigated for cross-ventilation using wind catchers. This paper, therefore, presents a detailed evaluation of the impact of the outlet openings on the ventilation performance of a single-zone isolated building with a wind catcher. The evaluation is based on three ventilation performance indicators: (i) induced airflow rate, (ii) age of air, and (iii) air change efficiency. High-resolution coupled 3D steady RANS CFD simulations of cross-ventilation are performed for different sizes and types of outlet openings. The CFD simulations are validated based on wind-tunnel measurements. The results show that using outlet openings very close to the wind catcher will not increase the induced airflow, while it leads to a considerable reduction in the indoor air quality. A combination of one-sided wind-catcher and window is superior, while the use of two-sided wind-catchers leads to the lowest indoor air quality and air change efficiency.
