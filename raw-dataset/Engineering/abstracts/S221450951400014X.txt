This paper aims to study the performance of asphalt concrete in which some of the fractional fine aggregate is substituted with crushed glass material. This asphalt containing glass cullet as an aggregate is called “glasphalt” and has been used as a means of disposing surplus waste glass since the 1960s. In this study, some important dynamic properties of glasphalt, including fatigue life, stiffness modulus and creep compliance, are investigated. The data show that the dynamic properties of glass–asphalt concrete are improved in comparison with ordinary asphalt concrete. The research has demonstrated that it is feasible to use and recycle waste glass in asphalt concrete.
