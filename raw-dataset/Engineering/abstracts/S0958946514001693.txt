This paper reports an assessment of the performance of concrete based on a calcium sulfoaluminate–anhydrite–fly ash cement combination. Concretes were prepared at three different w/c ratios and the properties were compared to those of Portland cement and blast-furnace cement concretes. The assessment involved determination of mechanical and durability properties. The results suggest that an advantageous synergistic effect between and ettringite and fly ash (Ioannou et al., 2014) was reflected in the concrete’s low water absorption rates, high sulfate resistance, and low chloride diffusion coefficients. However, carbonation depths, considering the dense ettringite-rich microstructure developed, were higher than those observed in Portland cement concretes at a given w/c ratio. It was concluded that the amount of alkali hydroxides present in the pore solution is as important factor as the w/c ratio when performance of this type of concrete is addressed.
