The performance of a pyrotechnic device consisting of donor/acceptor pair separated by a thin inert material or a gap relies on the shock sensitivity of the energetic materials and detonation shock attenuation in the gap. Despite its common use, full-scale numerical simulation of the device configured in an explosive train is seldom reported because the proper modeling of the entire process requires precise capturing of extreme pressure waves from a donor charge during its attenuation in the inert gap before triggering an acceptor charge and accurate description of high strain rate dynamics of both reactive and inert solids. We developed a hybrid particle level-set based multi-material hydrocode with reactive flow models for Donor (Pentolite) – Gap (PMMA) – Acceptor (aluminized RDX). The complex shock interaction, critical gap thickness, and Go/No-go characteristics of the explosive train were quantitatively investigated. An additional detailed simulation of a miniaturized pyrotechnic initiator in a train of Donor (HMX) – Gap (steel) – Acceptor (aluminized RDX) revealed the existence of a critical gap thickness for successful operation of a small device.
