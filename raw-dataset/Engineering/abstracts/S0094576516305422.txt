Spacecraft equipped with the capability to vary their ballistic coefficient can use differential drag as the control force to perform propellant-less relative maneuvers. Because atmospheric drag is proportional to atmospheric density, uncertainty in atmospheric density makes the generation and tracking of drag-based guidances difficult. Spatio-temporal resolution, or the mapping of density information to altitude and time, is shown in this work to improve atmospheric density estimation from forecasted density for spacecraft in LEO. This is achieved by propagating simulated orbits for two spacecraft using forecasted density. Additionally, a receding-horizon control algorithm is introduced, with the goal of improving the tracking of guidances. Using a simulated perfect forecast of the atmospheric density for propagation of the orbits, relative guidance trajectories are generated and tracked, establishing the benefit of adding spatio-temporal resolution. Next, imperfect density forecasting is added, indicating that the benefit of spatio-temporal resolution is retained in the presence of imperfect forecasting. Finally, a receding-horizon control algorithm is used with imperfect forecasting, demonstrating that receding-horizon control improves the tracking of guidances compared to single-horizon control.
