The concrete-faced rockfill dam (CFRD) is an important dam type in the selection of high dams to be constructed in Western China, owing to its direct utilization of local materials, good adaptability, and distinct economic advantages. Over the past decades, China has gained successful experience in the construction of 200m CFRDs, providing the necessary technical accumulation for the development of 250–300m ultra-high CFRDs. This paper summarizes these successful experiences and analyzes the problems of a number of major 200m CFRDs around the world. In addition, it discusses the key technologies and latest research progress regarding safety in the construction of 250–300m ultra-high CFRDs, and suggests focuses and general ideas for future research.
