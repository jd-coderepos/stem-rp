The interest in micro-technologies has increased in the last decades, because of the low volumes and high performance granted by their application. Micro-fins can find application in several fields, such as power electronics, concentrating photovoltaics and LED. Although micro-technologies have been widely applied in cooling, there is still a lack of knowledge on the thermal behavior of micro-finned heat sinks under natural convective conditions. In the present study, the correspondences between fin geometries and heat transfer coefficients, as well as the effects of the orientation, are experimentally investigated using silicon micro-finned heat sinks with different geometries. The heat sinks are made of 5cm√ó5cm squared silicon wafer and the fin height ranges between 0.6mm and 0.8mm, the spacing between 0.2mm and 0.8mm and the thickness between 0.2 and 0.8mm. Power loads higher than those considered in previous works are studied. The experimental setup is validated using a software simulation and the Nusselt number correlation available in literature. The influence of the fin thickness on this parameter is analyzed and a modified correlation is proposed. Also, the effect of the radiative heat exchange on the overall heat transfer is considered and commented. An analysis of the uncertainty is conducted and reported too.
