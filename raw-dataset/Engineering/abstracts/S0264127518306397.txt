This study was aimed at improving dissolution rate and sustained release of progesterone by varying copolymer composition and polymer: drug ratio of PLGA. Drug-loaded particles were prepared using electrohydrodynamic atomization. The effects of polymer: drug ratio and copolymer composition on particle properties and in vitro drug-release profile were investigated. The physical form of the generated particles was determined via X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Drug release in vitro was found to be dependent on copolymer composition, where the release rate increased with decreased lactide content of PLGA. Particles produced with solutions of copolymer (75:25) had elongated shapes. In general, the obtained results indicated that the prepared microparticles were ideal carriers for oral administration of progesterone offering great potential to improve the dissolution rate of drugs that suffer from low aqueous solubility.
