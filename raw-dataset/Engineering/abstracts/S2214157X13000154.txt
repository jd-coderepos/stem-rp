In the current study, the relation between the psychrometry working upon the thermodynamic analysis of humid air and drying at a timber dryer was investigated. In order to bring the air to suitable drying conditions, an air conditioner unit was used and the mass change of the unit with energy was analyzed. In the psychrometric analysis of the timber dryer with a heat pump, the pine and poplar timber were used. The mass change in the timber was followed with a load cell. At the end of the analysis, the amounts of humidity vaporized and intensified at the timber after drying were compared. Depending on these values, 5.7kg humidity was taken from the pine timber at the end of 50h, and 12.5kg from the poplar timber at the end of 70h.
