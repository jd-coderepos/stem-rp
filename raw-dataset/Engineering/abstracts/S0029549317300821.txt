For a given set of conditions in a boiling system the point of liquid film dryout or departure from nucleate boiling corresponds to the change from convective or nucleate boiling to transition or film boiling. This change is associated with a rapid deterioration of the heat transfer coefficient and the heat flux at this transition is denoted the critical heat flux (CHF). Computer models used to predict station transients and CHF rely heavily on empirical correlations to predict the CHF. Liquid film CHF data are usually obtained using a quasi-steady method wherein the heat flux is incremented in small steps with each step being allowed to reach a new equilibrium until an abnormal temperature increase is detected on the experimental surfaces. In applying a correlation derived from steady-state experiments to transient analyses these codes implicitly assume that dryout will occur for the same local conditions during transients as during steady state conditions. There is some disagreement in literature as to the validity of this hypothesis. This paper provides new steady-state and transient experimental data for CHF in water at intermediate pressures and demonstrates that for high-quality CHF that indeed CHF occurs at comparable local conditions during transients and steady-sate.
