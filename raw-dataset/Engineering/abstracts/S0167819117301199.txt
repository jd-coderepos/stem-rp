The performance of AllReduce is crucial at scale. The recursive doubling with pairwise exchange algorithm theoretically achieves O(log2 N) scaling for short messages with N peers, but is limited by improvements in network latency. A multi-way exchange can be implemented using message pipelining, which is easier to improve than latency. Using our method, recursive multiplying, we show reductions in execution time of between 8% and 40% of AllReduce on a Cray XC30 over recursive doubling. Using a custom simulator we further explore the dynamics of recursive multiplying.
