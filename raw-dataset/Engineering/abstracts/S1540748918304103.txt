Experimental and computational investigations are carried out to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of autoignition of surrogates of jet-fuels at elevated pressures up to 6 bar. The jet-fuels tested are JP-8, Jet-A, and JP-5, and the surrogates tested are the Aachen Surrogate made up of 80 % n-decane and 20 % 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene by mass, Surrogate C made up of 60 % n-dodecane, 20 % methylcyclohexane and 20 % o-xylene by volume, and the 2nd generation Princeton Surrogate made up of 40.4 % n-dodecane, 29.5 % 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, 7.3 % 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene and 22.8 % n-propylbenzene by mole. Using the counterflow configuration, an axisymmetric flow of a gaseous oxidizer stream, made up of a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, is directed over the surface of an evaporating pool of a liquid fuel. The experiments are conducted at a fixed value of mass fraction of oxygen in the oxidizer stream and at a fixed value of the strain rate. The temperature of the oxidizer stream at autoignition, T ig, is measured as a function of pressure, p. Experimental results show that the critical conditions, of autoignition of the surrogates are close to that of the jet-fuels. Overall the critical conditions of autoignition of Surrogate C agree best with those of the jet-fuels. Computations were performed using skeletal mechanisms constructed from a detailed mechanism. Predictions of the critical conditions of autoignition of the surrogates are found to agree well with measurements. Computations show that low-temperature chemistry plays a significant role in promoting autoignition for all surrogates. The low-temperature chemistry, of the component of the surrogate with the greatest volatility, was found to have the most influence on the critical conditions of autoignition.
