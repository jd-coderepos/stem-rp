Sea states, such as waves, tidal currents, and wind are important factors for safe and economic ship navigation. In previous papers of Xia et al. (2006a, 2006b) single factor generated by low pressure was studied independently. The objective of this paper is to study how ship navigation is affected by the combined effects of these factors. For clarification, simulations of two representative typhoons were conducted, and the results were compared. Numerical simulations of tidal currents, waves, and wind were applied to provide high-resolution information, which was then used to simulate ship navigation. Estimation of ship position was found effectively by comparing the results from these two cases and using the proposed numerical navigation simulation method.
