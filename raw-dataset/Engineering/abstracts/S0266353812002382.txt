A novel robust non-woven sisal fibre preform was manufactured using a papermaking process utilising nanosized bacterial cellulose (BC) as binder for the sisal fibres. It was found that BC provides significant mechanical strength to the sisal fibre preforms. This can be attributed to the high stiffness and strength of the BC network. Truly green non-woven fibre preform reinforced hierarchical composites were prepared by infusing the fibre preforms with acrylated epoxidised soybean oil (AESO) using vacuum assisted resin infusion, followed by thermal curing. Both the tensile and flexural properties of the hierarchical composites showed significant improvements over polyAESO and neat sisal fibre preform reinforced polyAESO. These results were corroborated by the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the (hierarchical) composites, which showed an increased storage modulus and enhanced fibre–matrix stress transfer. Micromechanical modelling was also performed on the (hierarchical) composites. By using BC as binder for short sisal fibres, added benefits such as the high Young’s modulus of BC, enhanced fibre–fibre and fibre–matrix stress transfer can be utilised in the resulting hierarchical composites.
