The investigation of edge plasmas at the stellarator W7-X requires a flexible tool for integration of a variety of different diagnostics as e.g. electrical probes, probing magnetic coils, material collection, or material exposition probes, and gas injection. A multi-purpose manipulator (MPM) system has been developed and attached to the W7-X vessel before the operational phase 1.1. The system was designed as user facility for many diagnostics, which can be mounted on a unique interface without breaking the W7-X vacuum. The manipulator system, located in the equatorial plane, transports the inserted diagnostic probe to the edge of the inner vacuum vessel. From there, the probe can be moved over a maximum distance of 350mm to different positions inside the plasma with a maximum acceleration and deceleration of 30m/s2. Acceleration, speed, and stroke depth are individually adjustable and programmable by a PLC system within predetermined limits. The MPM system can be equipped with multifunctional probes and is prepared for cooling/heating of the probe head, gas injection, and a flexible setting of the electrical diagnostic. In the paper, the MPM components, their functionalities, and the interface to the probe head are described. The scope of physical parameters is presented for the development of diagnostic probes applicable in the MPM user facility. This also includes the operational parameters for the movements and the electrical environment for measurements. The operation of the MPM during the OP1.1 is demonstrated on the application of a multipurpose probe head, including electric, magnetic, and thermal probes.
