The article reports the electrochemical deposition and characterisation of a 600nm thick Fe–Ga alloy film plated on a 20μm thick copper cantilever. The co-electrodeposition process was optimised for the production of Fe–Ga in the ratio of 81% Fe to 19% Ga, which is known to maximize the magnetostriction (MS) effect. The foil was cut into 1mm wide and 5mm long cantilevers and the deflection was measured with DC co-planar magnetic field intensities ranging from 0 to 60kA/m. The maximum strain coefficient λ was measured to be 96ppm for a field strength range 58kA/m. The field strain plot over exhibits a typical second order magnetically induced strain curve, as seen in other magnetostrictive materials.
