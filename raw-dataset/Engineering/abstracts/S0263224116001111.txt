This paper presents a method for real-time online monitoring of shaft misalignment, which is a common problem in rotating machinery, such as the drive train of wind turbines. A non-contact laser based measurement method is used to monitor positional changes of a rotating shaft in real time while in operation. The results are then used to detect the presence of shaft misalignment. An experimental test rig is designed to measure shaft misalignment and the results from the work show that the technique can be used for the monitoring of both offset and angular shaft misalignment, which will have applications in the condition monitoring and maintenance of various types of rotating machinery.
