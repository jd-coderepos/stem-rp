This paper deals with the steady state thermal analysis of diesel engine piston coated with ceramic coating having holes on its surface. Temperature distribution on the piston's top surface and substrate surface is investigated by using finite element based software called Ansys. Yttria-stabilized Zirconia is used as ceramic coating applied on Alâ€“Si piston crown. The 2 thickness of ceramic top coating is about 0.4mm and for NiCrAl bond coat it is taken to be 0.1mm. Temperature distribution is investigated by choosing various radiuses of holes created on the ceramic coating surface about 1.5mm, 2mm and 2.5mm. From the results it is observed that the top surface (coated surface) temperature is increasing with increase the radius of the holes. Maximum temperature of coated surface is occurs for highest hole radius of about 2.5mm. Compared with coating have no hole, a significant increase in the pistons top surface temperature occurs with coating having holes. Although, the substrate temperature is decreasing with increase the radius of the holes.
