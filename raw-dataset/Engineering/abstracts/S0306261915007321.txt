A steady state analysis method was developed for gas networks with distributed injection of alternative gas. A low pressure gas network was used to validate the method. Case studies were carried out with centralized and decentralized injection of hydrogen and upgraded biogas. Results show the impact of utilizing a diversity of gas supply sources on pressure distribution and gas quality in the network. It is shown that appropriate management of using a diversity of gas supply sources can support network management while reducing carbon emissions.
