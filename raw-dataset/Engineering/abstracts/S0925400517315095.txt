In this paper we report on the development of an aerosol jet printed sensing platform integrating elements of silicon and printed electronics. To demonstrate the technology, thin film humidity sensors have been fabricated over the top surface and sides of pre-packaged integrated circuits using a combination of direct-write aerosol jet deposition and drop-casting. The resistive based sensor consists of an aerosol jet deposited interdigitated nano-particle silver electrode structure overlaid with a thin film of Nafion® acting as a humidity sensitive layer. The fabricated sensor displayed a strong response to changes in relative humidity over the tested range (40% RH–80% RH) and showed a low level of hysteresis whilst undergoing cyclic testing. The successful fabrication of relative humidity sensors over the surface and pins of a packaged integrated circuit demonstrates a new level of integration between printed and silicon based electronics – leading to Printed-Sensor-on-Chip devices. Whilst demonstrated for humidity, the proposed concept is envisaged to work as a platform for a wide range of applications, from bio-sensing to temperature or gas monitoring.
