The relationship between the efficacy of resuscitation and the mattresses and backboards used in acute care units, has been studied previously. However, few reports focus on the relative efficacy of resuscitation when using mattresses with different modes of function. This study examines the performance of different support surfaces during experimental cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The surfaces included a hard surface, a higher specification foam mattress, a dynamic, alternating pressure mattress, and a dynamic, reactive minimum pressure air mattress system. A pressure sensitive mat was placed between the mattresses and each surface and the efficacy of resuscitation measured using differences in compression frequency, compression depth and hands-on time. Our results suggest that the efficacy of resuscitation is dependent on the mode of action of the mattress, while adequate compression frequency and depth do not have a significant effect. In the open system alternating mattress, deflation of the mattress using the CPR function improved the stability of the resuscitation in our study, especially in situations where the height of the air mattress is greater than 20â€“25 centimeters. Using our experimental system, resuscitation on a closed air system mattress optimally combined stability and effort, while the CPR function converts the air system of the mattress to open, which impairs its functionality during resuscitation. These results indicate that resuscitation is dependent of the mode of action of the mattress and whether the mattress-specific CPR function was used or not. However, the interactions are complex and are dependent on the interaction between the body and the mattress, i.e. its immersion and envelopment properties. Furthermore, this study casts doubt on the necessity of the CPR function in air mattresses.
