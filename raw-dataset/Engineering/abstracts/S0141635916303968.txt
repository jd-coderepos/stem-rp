Large-scale rotors in the paper and steel industry are called rolls. Rolls are reground at regular intervals and roundness measurements are made throughout the machining process. Measurement systems for roundness and diameter variation of large rolls (diameter <2000mm) are available on the market, and generally use two to four sensors and a roundness measurement algorithm. These methods are intended to separate roundness of the rotor from its movement. The hybrid four-point method has improved accuracy, even for harmonic component amplitudes. For reliable measurement results, every measurement should be traceable with an estimation of measurement uncertainty. In this paper, the Monte-Carlo method is used for uncertainty evaluation of the harmonic components of the measured roundness profile under typical industrial conditions. According to the evaluation, the standard uncertainties for the harmonic amplitudes with the hybrid method are below 0.5μm for the even harmonics and from 1.5μm to 2.5μm for the odd harmonics, when the standard uncertainty for the four probes is 0.3μm each. The standard uncertainty for roundness deviation is 3.3μm.
