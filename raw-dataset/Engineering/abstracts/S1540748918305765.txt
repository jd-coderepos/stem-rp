Azimuthal forcing has been applied to flames in a laboratory scale annular combustor in order to accurately control the azimuthal mode of excitation. A new forcing configuration permitted not only the pressure amplitude, but also the spin ratio and mode orientation to be accurately controlled, in order to generate standing modes and for the first time strong spinning modes in both a clockwise (CW) and anti-clockwise (ACW) direction. The phase averaged heat release dynamics of these modes was compared and a number of differences observed depending on the direction of pressure wave propagation, demonstrating characteristic ACW and CW heat release patterns. A new spin compensating averaging method was then introduced to analyse the flame dynamics, and it was shown that through the application of this method the dynamics of standing wave oscillations could be decomposed to recover the characteristic ACW and CW heat release responses. The global heat release response was also assessed during strongly spinning modes, and the magnitude of the response was shown to depend strongly on the direction of propagation, demonstrating the importance of the local swirl direction on the global heat release response, with important implications for the modelling of such flows.
