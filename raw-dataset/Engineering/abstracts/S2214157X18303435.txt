The resistance of beam-to-column connections to fire is an important consideration for the design of steel moment frames. The authors seek to study the effect of fire on such connections using finite element modeling in ABAQUS. The previously published first part of this paper detailed and validated the simulation technique by comparing model results to experimental results reported elsewhere in the literature. This, the second part of the paper, seeks to demonstrate the performance of four types of connections exposed to thermal loading: (1) bolted end plate, (2) bolted cover plate, (3) bolted tee, and (4) welded cover plate. A numerical study was performed to quantify the effects of thermal loading on beam buckling, displacement, rotation, connection stiffness, and moment-rotation behavior at temperatures between 20 and 900 Â°C. The bolted end plate connection exhibited the highest resistance to thermal loading with a significantly lower degree of degradation in connection performance compared to the other three connection types.
