Currently, in order to create a sharp pre-crack in a polymeric material for fracture toughness testing, a hand-held razor blade is used. This technique produces cracks of varying angle, length, and crack-front shape. Additionally, there are considerable safety concerns regarding the handling of sharp razor blades. A repeatable, safe method of producing a consistent, sharp pre-crack of a specified length, orientation and crack front is presented here, by use of a simple custom fixture. The specimen preparation procedure has wide applicability for fracture analysis of many brittle materials.
