In this paper a piecewise exponential model is proposed for analysis of three-dimensional elastic deformation of rectangular sandwich panels with graded core subjected to transverse loading. The model can be applied to any functionally graded plate or sandwich panel with graded core as long as the through thickness stiffness variation can be described by a smooth function. The new piecewise exponential model is fully validated through both comparison with results from the literature and a three-dimensional finite element method which employs user-implemented graded finite elements. As an example the new model is applied to three dimensional elasticity analysis of sandwich panels with power law variation in stiffness properties of the core and a comparative study is carried out to examine the effect of panel thickness and varying the power law index on panelâ€™s response.
