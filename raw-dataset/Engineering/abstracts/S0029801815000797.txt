Emissions in the shipping industry are a major environmental concern and IMO regulations are increasingly stringent. Existing methods to assess marine exhaust gas emissions require large and specialised input data-sets. There is therefore a requirement for a methodology which can resolve the dilemma of estimating time-varying gas properties with sufficient accuracy to, for example, predict NO X emissions, whilst also being applicable across the variety of engine types and operational modes that prevail in the marine context, for which there is often sparse input data. In this paper, the influence upon thermal efficiency and the prediction of gas temperature time-histories of differing levels of sophistication in modelled gas properties and composition models is therefore evaluated, as is the effect of modelling engine losses. Using the results of this study, a coupled dynamic-thermodynamic engine simulation in the time-domain is developed, capable of modelling engine performance across the full range of operational conditions (speed and load), including part-load and transient conditions. The simulation is validated against the Otto cycle and through simulations of experimental engine data, the model is shown to successfully predict actual engine performance across a range of engine load conditions.
