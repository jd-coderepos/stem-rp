Thin films of fluorine doped tin oxide were deposited, by an aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition route, to study the effect of scaling the growth rate. The effect of precursor concentration on the growth rate of the films and the properties of deposited films were compared. The films were characterised by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, UV/vis spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Hall effect measurements. A maximum film growth rate of ca. 100nmminâˆ’1 was observed, which is significantly faster than previously reported aerosol assisted studies. This method shows the ability of aerosol assisted methods to deliver high growth rates whilst maintaining the ease of doping and control over stoichiometry.
