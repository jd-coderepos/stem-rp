A virtual Taylor impact of cellular materials is analyzed with a wave propagation technique, i.e. the Lagrangian analysis method, of which the main advantage is that no pre-assumed constitutive relationship is required. Time histories of particle velocity, local strain, and stress profiles are calculated to present the local stress–strain history curves, from which the dynamic stress–strain states are obtained. The present results reveal that the dynamic-rigid-plastic hardening (D-R-PH) material model introduced in a previous study of our group is in good agreement with the dynamic stress–strain states under high loading rates obtained by the Lagrangian analysis method. It directly reflects the effectiveness and feasibility of the D-R-PH material model for the cellular materials under high loading rates.
