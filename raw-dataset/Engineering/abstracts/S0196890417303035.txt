Partially premixed combustion using gasoline-like fuels on compression ignition engines shows great potentials to break the soot-nitrogen oxides trade off and reduce both emissions simultaneously. By simply adjusting the dilution strategies and injection events, the control of partially premixed combustion is relatively easier compared to other low-temperature combustion concepts. However despite these advantages, recent research shows this concept tends to emit ultra-fine particles. Most previous work on partially premixed combustion only focuses on the soot emissions while the particulate matter in terms of number concentration and size distribution are not well investigated. Ultra-fine particles are dangerous to human health and are getting increasing attentions. Thus the detailed particulate matter emission from partially premixed combustion needs to be further investigated. In this work four gasoline-like ternary fuel blends are designed and experimentally tested under partially premixed combustion. The test blends all share the same two base fuels and blended with different additives. The fuel composition is varied to have the same research octane number. Tests are conducted under different engine loads and dilution strategies since the temperature and oxygen concentration are the key factors in the formation and oxidation of soot. Standard diesel is also tested under the same conditions as a comparison. It is found that these blends are capable of running under partially premixed combustion at low and medium loads and they produce near zero soot emissions when using high exhaust gas recirculation rate. However, these blends do emit smaller particles than diesel under all test loads. Besides, blends with oxygen content yield less soot emissions and smaller particles compared to non-oxygen blends.
