Adiabatic shear band (ASB) formation in textured HCP polycrystals has been investigated under regimes of high rate compression and shear loading using dynamic thermo-mechanically coupled, dislocation-based crystal plasticity modelling. The balance between rate of plastic dissipation leading to internal heat generation versus rate of thermal diffusion at a crystallographic length scale has been shown to be pivotal for the formation or otherwise of ASBs. Micro-texture has been found to have a key role in both advancing and inhibiting shear band growth, and its control offers the possibility of new alloys with higher impact strength over strain rate range1 × 10−2 to 1 × 105 s−1. Texture has been found to lead to wide variations in applied macroscopic strain at which ASB formation occurs, such that strain level in isolation is inappropriate as a universal indicator of ASB onset. High-rate shear loading is found to lead to lower onset strains for ASBs compared to high rate compression, but the dependence of both on texture leads to considerable variation in strain level for ASB formation. A preliminary map demarcating ASB onset has been established over regimes of applied strain and texture for dynamic shear and compression.
