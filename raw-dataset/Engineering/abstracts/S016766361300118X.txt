A numerical investigation has been conducted to determine the influence of Representative Volume Element (RVE) size and degree of irregularity of polymer foam microstructure on its compressive mechanical properties, including stiffness, plateau stress and onset strain of densification. Periodic two-dimensional RVEs have been generated using a Voronoi-based numerical algorithm and compressed. Importantly, self-contact of the foamâ€™s internal microstructure has been incorporated through the use of shell elements, allowing simulation of the foam well into the densification stage of compression; strains of up to 80% are applied. Results suggest that the stiffness of the foam RVE is relatively insensitive to RVE size but tends to soften as the degree of irregularity increases. Both the shape of the plateau stress and the onset strain of densification are sensitive to both the RVE size and degree of irregularity. Increasing the RVE size and decreasing the degree of irregularity both tend to result in a decrease of the gradient of the plateau region, while increasing the RVE size and degree of irregularity both tend to decrease the onset strain of densification. Finally, a method of predicting the onset strain of densification to an accuracy of about 10%, while reducing the computational cost by two orders of magnitude is suggested.
