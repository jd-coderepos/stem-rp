We consider a hyperbolic system of partial differential equations which is of interest in the context of nonlinear chromatography. Under certain initial and feed conditions, specified in the first part of this contribution, solutions to this system are unbounded. Characteristic properties of the singular shocks, i.e. propagation velocity and strength, are derived by two different approaches, based on Colombeau generalized functions and on box approximations of the unbounded solution, respectively. The derived expressions are found to be consistent for both approaches.
