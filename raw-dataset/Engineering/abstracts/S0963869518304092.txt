A new high-power electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) solid state pulser system has been developed that is capable of driving up to 4 EMAT coils with programmable phase delays, allowing for focusing and steering of the acoustic field. Each channel is capable of supplying an excitation current of up to 1.75 kA for a pulse with a rise time of 1 Î¼s. Finite element and experimental data are presented which demonstrate a signal enhancement by a factor of 3.5 (compared to a single EMAT coil) when using the system to transmit a longitudinal ultrasound pulse through a 22.5 cm thick as-cast steel slab sample. Further signal enhancement is demonstrated through the use of an array of detection EMATs, and a demonstration of artificial internal defect detection is presented on a thick steel sample. The design of this system is such that it has the potential to be employed at elevated temperatures for diagnostic measurements of steel during the continuous casting process.
