Process and energy models provide an invaluable tool for design, analysis and optimisation. These models are usually based upon a number of assumptions, simplifications and approximations, thereby introducing uncertainty in the model predictions. Making model based optimal decisions under uncertainty is therefore a challenging task. This issue is further exacerbated when more than one objective is to be optimised simultaneously, resulting in a Multi-Objective Optimisation ( MO 2 ) problem. Even though, some methods have been proposed for MO 2 problems under uncertainty, two separate optimisation techniques are employed; one to address the multi-objective aspect and another to take into account uncertainty. In the present work, we propose a unified optimisation framework for linear MO 2 problems, in which the uncertainty and the multiple objectives are modelled as varying parameters. The MO 2 under uncertainty problem ( MO 2 U 2 ) is thus reformulated and solved as a multi-parametric programming problem. The solution of the multi-parametric programming problem provides the optimal solution as a set of parametric profiles.
