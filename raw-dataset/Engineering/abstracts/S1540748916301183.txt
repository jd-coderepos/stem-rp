A method that is based on the initial slagging routes and the sintered/slagging route has been developed and used for predicting the ash deposition propensities of coal combustion in utility boilers supported by the data collected from power stations. Two types of initial slagging routes are considered, namely (i) pyrite-induced initial slagging on the furnace wall, and (ii) fouling caused by the alkaline/alkali components condensation in the convection section. In addition, the sintered/slagging route is considered by the liquids temperature, which represents the melting potential of the main ash composition and is calculated using the chemical equilibrium methods. The partial least square regression (PLSR) technique, coupled with a cross validation method, is employed to obtain the correlation for the ash deposition indice. The method has been successfully applied to coals/blends combustion in boilers, ranging from low rank coals to bituminous coal. The results obtained show that the developed indice yields a higher success rate in classifying the overall slagging/fouling potential in boilers than some of the typical slagging indices. In addition, only using the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio to predict the melting behaviors and slagging potential is inaccurate since the effect of the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is dictated by both the original ash composition and the way in which the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is changed. Finally, the influence of the acid components (SiO2 and Al2O3) on the ash deposition prediction is investigated for guiding the mineral additives. It is noticed that the predicted ash deposition potentials of the three easy slagging coals investigated decrease more rapidly by adding Al2O3 than by adding SiO2.
