A unified classification framework for models of extended plasticity is presented. The models include well known micromorphic and strain-gradient plasticity formulations. A unified treatment is possible due to the representation of strain-gradient plasticity within an Eringen-type micromorphic framework. The classification is based on the form of the energetic and dissipative model structures and exploits the framework of dissipation-consistent modelling to elucidate the flow relation and yield condition. Models are identified as either serial or parallel. This designation is also applicable to familiar models of classical plasticity. Particular attention is paid to the rate-dependent problem arising from the choice of a smooth dissipation potential. The inability to locally determine the region of admissible stresses for the non-smooth (rate-independent) parallel models of plasticity is made clear.
