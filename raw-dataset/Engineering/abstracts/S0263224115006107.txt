A novel probe head design is introduced, which enables in-line monitoring of particle sizes in undiluted stirred fluids using dynamic light scattering. The novel probe head separates a small sample volume of 0.65ml from the bulk liquid by means of an impeller. In this sample volume, particle sizing is performed using a commercially available fiber-optical backscatter probe. While conventional light scattering measurements in stirred media fail due to the superposition of Brownianâ€™ motion and forced convection, undistorted measurements are possible with the proposed probe head. One measurement takes approximately 30s used for liquid exchange by rotation of the impeller and for collection of scattered light. The probe head is applied for in-line monitoring of the particle growth during microgel synthesis by precipitation polymerization in a one liter laboratory reactor. The in-line measurements are compared to off-line measurements and show a good agreement.
