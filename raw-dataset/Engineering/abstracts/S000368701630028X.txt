We aimed to quantify the inertial parameters of the lower trunk segment in pregnant Japanese women and compare kinetic data during tasks calculated with parameters estimated in this study to data calculated with standard parameters. Eight pregnant women and seven nulliparous women participated. Twenty-four infrared reflective markers were attached to the lower trunk, and the standing position was captured by eight infrared cameras. The lower trunk was divided into parts, and inertial parameters were calculated. Pregnant women performed a movement task that involved standing from a chair, picking up plates, and walking forward after turning to the right. Kinetic analysis was performed using standard inertial parameters and the newly calculated parameters. There were more significant differences between methods in the kinetic data at the latter stages of pregnancy. The inertial parameters calculated in this study should be used to ensure the validity of biomechanical studies of pregnant Japanese women.
