Knowledge of the vertical wind-speed profile in cities is important for the construction and insurance industries, wind energy predictions, and simulations of pollutant and toxic gas release. Here, five methods to estimate the spatially- and temporally-averaged wind-speed profile are compared in London: the logarithmic wind law (LOG); the Deaves and Harris equilibrium (DH e ) and non-equilibrium (DH v ) models; an adaptation of the power law (PL) and the Gryning et al. (GR) profile. Using measurements at 2.5 times the average building height, a source area model is used to determine aerodynamic roughness parameters using two morphometric methods, which assume homogeneous and variable roughness-element heights, respectively. Hourly-averaged wind speeds are extrapolated to 200 m above the canopy during strong wind conditions, and compared to wind speeds observed with Doppler lidar. Wind speeds are consistently underestimated if roughness-element height variability is not considered during aerodynamic parameter determination. Considering height variability, the resulting estimations with the DH e and GR profiles are marginally more similar to observations than the DH v profile, which is more accurate than the LOG and PL methods. An exception is in directions with more homogeneous fetch and a gradual reduction in upwind roughness, where the LOG and PL profiles are more appropriate.
