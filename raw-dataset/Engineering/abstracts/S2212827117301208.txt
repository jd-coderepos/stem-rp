Operational management is a key contributor in life cycle costs, especially for large scale assets which are in most times complex in structural hierarchy and with a large nominal service life. Decisions on the operational management may concern the number of inspections or maintenance strategies which may allow full utilization of structural capacity or sacrifice residual life in order to avoid an unscheduled intervention. Design of such assets is often governed by design standards which offer the designer the flexibility to take certain decisions that may affect the CAPEX to OPEX ratio such as that of building a more robust structure which may eliminate the need for costly inspection operations. This paper is investigating this approach, taking the example of offshore wind turbine support structures as the reference case, and examines the relevant provisions of the DNV-Os-J101 Standard with respect to the design implications that such a decision may have to the overall life-cycle cost of the structure. Assessment of the structural properties under different design conditions is evaluated through a combination of detailed cost model and an iterative optimization algorithm. The approach which is followed and documented, can be applicable to other complex structural systems for decision making through evaluation of service life costs.
