This paper describes an experimental investigation on the pressure dip phenomenon in a conical pile of granular solids. The roles of different deposition processes such as the pouring rate, pouring height and deposition jet size on the pressure dip formation were studied. Test results confirmed that the pressure dip is a robust phenomenon in a pile formed by top deposition. When the deposition jet radius is significantly smaller than the final pile radius (i.e. concentrated deposition), a dip developed in the centre as shown in previous studies. However, when the deposition jet radius is comparable to the final pile radius (i.e. diffuse deposition), the location of the dip moves towards the edge of deposition jet, with a local maximum pressure developed in the centre. For concentrated deposition, an increase in the pouring rate may enhance the depth of the dip and reduce its width, while an increase in the pouring height has only a negligible effect in the studied range. The results suggest the pressure dip is closely related to the initial location, intensity and form of downslope flows.
