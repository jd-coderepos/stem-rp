Diffusion sensors for nano-sized materials dispersed in a solution are promising tools for investigating intermolecular interactions, which is an important task in a wide range of industrial and biomedical fields, such as the development of therapeutic products and diagnostic tools. For the development of the sensor applicable to point-of-care testing, an optofluidic sensor was proposed. The proposed sensor realizes a simple measurement in a short time using microscale manipulation by interferometrically-induced dielectrophoresis and optical detection. In this paper, the applicability of the proposed sensor to distinguish nanoscale differences in size was confirmed by measurements on a solution containing size-certified plain nano-beads (51 nm, 100 nm, 203 nm, 216 nm and 240 nm) with evaluating the uncertainties of the proposed sensor. Furthermore, measurements using 200-nm beads coated with functional groups (NH2 and biotin) and proteins (streptavidin and bovine serum albumin) demonstrated the applicability to the investigation of intermolecular interactions.
