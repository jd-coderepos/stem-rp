This paper is a study of the dependence of the volume of voids in a granular material on the particle size distribution. It has previously been proposed that the volume of voids is proportional to the volume of the smallest particles. In a particle size distribution which is progressively becoming wider (e.g. as occurs due to crushing during the compression of sand), the smallest size of particle decreases, yet there are only ever a few of these particles out of many thousands or millions. This paper attempts to identify which particles govern the overall density of a granular material, and a new definition of the ‘smallest particles’ is proposed. These particles are shown to govern the void space in a range of simulations of spherical and non-spherical crushable particles. The theory also applies to idealised Apollonian sphere packings.
