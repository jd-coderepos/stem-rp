A novel measure of neural spike train randomness, an entropy factor, is proposed. It is based on the Shannon entropy of the number of spikes in a time window and can be seen as an analogy to the Fano factor. Theoretical properties of the new measure are studied for equilibrium renewal processes and further illustrated on gamma and inverse Gaussian probability distributions of interspike intervals. Finally, the entropy factor is evaluated from the experimental records of spontaneous activity in macaque primary visual cortex and compared to its theoretical behavior deduced for the renewal process models. Both theoretical and experimental results show substantial differences between the Fano and entropy factors. Rather paradoxically, an increase in the variability of spike count is often accompanied by an increase of its predictability, as evidenced by the entropy factor.
