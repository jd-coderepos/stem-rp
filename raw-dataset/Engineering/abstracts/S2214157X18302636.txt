The response rules of the surface temperature with indoor air temperature have been particularly important under the air-conditioning and heating intermittent operation due to their affecting the thermal comfortable level and building energy consumption. In this study, a homogeneity wall was built and the effect of many parameters including the density, the specific heat capacity, the heat conductivity coefficient, the convective heat transfer coefficient, initial temperature and setting temperature of indoor air was analyzed on the response rules of surface temperatures by the analytical solution of the one-dimensional and unsteady heat conduction equation. And a multi-factor coupling regression formula was obtained for the time constant, which was used to evaluate the response rate of inner surface temperature.
