The boundary-layer flow due to a rotating disk is considered for a number of generalised Newtonian fluid models. In the limit of large Reynolds number the flow inside the three-dimensional boundary-layer is determined via a similarity solution. Results for power-law and Bingham plastic fluids agree with previous investigations. We present solutions for fluids that adhere to the Carreau viscosity model. It is well known that unlike the power-law and Bingham models the Carreau model is applicable for vanishingly small, and infinitely large shear rates, as such we suggest these results provide a more accurate description of non-Newtonian rotating disk flow.
