In our previous two works, we studied the blow-up and lifespan estimates for damped wave equations with a power nonlinearity of the solution or its derivative, with scattering damping independently. In this work, we are devoted to establishing a similar result for a combined nonlinearity. Comparing to the result of wave equation without damping, one can say that the scattering damping has no influence.
