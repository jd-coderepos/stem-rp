Pastes of white Portland cement (wPc) and wPc-pulverized fuel ash (pfa) blends were studied up to 13years. The reaction of wPc with water was initially retarded in the presence of pfa particles but accelerated at intermediate ages. Reaction with KOH solution was rapid with or without pfa. A universal compositional relationship exists for the C-A-S-H in blends of Pc with aluminosilicate-rich SCMs. The average length of aluminosilicate anions increased with age and increasing Al/Ca and Si/Ca; greater lengthening in the blends was due to additional Al3+ at bridging sites. The morphology of outer product C-A-S-H was always foil-like with KOH solution, regardless of chemical composition, but with water it had fibrillar morphology at high Ca/(Si+Al) ratios and foil-like morphology started to appear at Ca/(Si+Al) ≈1.2–1.3, which from the literature appears to coincide with changes in the pore solution. Foil-like morphology cannot be associated with entirely T-based structure.
