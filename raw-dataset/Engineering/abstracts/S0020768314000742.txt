The paper presents a systematic study of dispersive waves in an elastic chiral lattice. Chirality is introduced through gyroscopes embedded into the junctions of a doubly periodic lattice. Bloch–Floquet waves are assumed to satisfy the quasi-periodicity conditions on the elementary cell. New features of the system include degeneracy due to the rotational action of the built-in gyroscopes and polarisation leading to the dominance of shear waves within a certain range of values of the constant characterising the rotational action of the gyroscopes. Special attention is given to the analysis of Bloch–Floquet waves in the neighbourhoods of critical points of the dispersion surfaces, where standing waves of different types occur. The theoretical model is accompanied by numerical simulations demonstrating directional localisation and dynamic anisotropy of the system.
