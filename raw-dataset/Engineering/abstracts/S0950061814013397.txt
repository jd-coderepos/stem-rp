PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) is one of the most common plastics for various productions. The rapid increase in the use of these products causes increment in solid waste problems. Eventually, management and prevention of solid waste resulted by urban and industrial waste are dramatically important. On the other hand, deterioration of sewage purification structures, part of industrial structures and concrete sewer pipes attacked by sulfuric acid is an important issue of the world that has communicated with substantial financial need in all countries. Thus, not so many researches has been investigated the effect of sulfuric acid erosion on concrete containing PET particles, this study represents the laboratory investigation of different values of 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% of PET particles as an alternative aggregate on erosion caused by sulfuric acid in concrete. All samples were cured during 28days, 3 samples from each mix design were tested, finally. In intervals of 15, 30, and 60days of immersion in 5% sulfuric acid, 3 specimens were taken out from sulfuric acid solution. Then, after drying these specimens and measuring their dimensions, crushing load, weight and ultrasonic wave velocity values were obtained. The results showed that by increasing in amount of PET particles as an alternative aggregates in concrete, there is less reduction in values of crushing load, weight loss and ultrasonic wave velocity. Also, it could be seen that ratios of crushing load reduction to weight loss for specimens attacked by 5% sulfuric acid solution were increased by increasing in percentage of PET particles, which illustrates that in a particular range of crushing load, less weight loss was occurred in concretes included more PET particles.
