A detailed experimental investigation of the hydrodynamics of large-scale, bore-driven swash on steep permeable, rough beaches is described. The experiments were carried out on two permeable, but fixed rough beaches, made of 1.3mm sand and 8.4mm gravel, respectively. The large-scale discrete swash event was produced by the collapse of a dam break-generated bore on the beach. Simultaneous depths and velocities were measured using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), and particle image velocimetry (PIV), respectively. Depth time series, instantaneous velocity profiles, depth-averaged velocities, instantaneous turbulent kinetic energy profiles, depth-averaged turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent shear stress profiles and bed shear stresses are presented for several cross-shore measurement locations in the swash. The effect of beach permeability is investigated by comparing new experimental results with previously published data for impermeable beaches with identical surface roughness (Kikkert et al., 2012). The detailed data can be used to test and develop advanced numerical models for bore-driven swash on rough permeable beaches.
