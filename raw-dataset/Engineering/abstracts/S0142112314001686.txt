Laser shock processing is a recently developed surface treatment designed to improve the mechanical properties and fatigue performance of materials, by inducing a deep compressive residual stress field. The purpose of this work is to investigate the residual stress distribution induced by laser shock processing in a 2050-T8 aeronautical aluminium alloy with both X-ray diffraction measurements and 3D finite element simulation. The method of X-ray diffraction is extensively used to characterize the crystallographic texture and the residual stress crystalline materials at different scales (macroscopic, mesoscopic and microscopic). Shock loading and materialsâ€™ dynamic response are experimentally analysed using Doppler velocimetry in order to use adequate data for the simulation. Then systematic experience versus simulation comparisons are addressed, considering first a single impact loading, and in a second step the laser shock processing treatment of an extended area, with a specific focus on impact overlap. Experimental and numerical results indicate a residual stress anisotropy, and a better surface stress homogeneity with an increase of impact overlap. A correct agreement is globally shown between experimental and simulated residual stress values, even if simulations provide us with local stress values whereas X-ray diffraction determinations give averaged residual stresses.
