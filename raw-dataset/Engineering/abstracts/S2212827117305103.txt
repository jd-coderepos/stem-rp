The minimization of energy, waste, and emissions in operations are the foremost sustainability goals in industry. The shift from a linear product lifecycle to a circular one is required, along with increased energy efficiency and reduced resource use, to achieve these goals. This paper examines how the use of Re-Distributed Manufacturing (RdM) and a Product-Service System (PSS) approach, while leveraging the latest digital manufacturing technologies, enables the shift to this new economic model. A case study illustrates this new approach and relates it to the shoe manufacturing industry. The ShoeLab case study includes an outline of the business model options supporting this new approach to sustainable production highlighting the circularity that may be achieved in employing RdM and the latest digital manufacturing technologies in the form of 3-D printing. The research conducted indicates that using IDEF0 modelling could help to realize the full potential of RdM such as the manufacturing and transport of products involving less material, energy and waste.
