Soft Open Point (SOP) is a power electronic device installed in place of normally open points in electrical distribution networks. This paper investigates the dynamic performance of a medium voltage (MV) distribution network with a connected SOP, under grid side AC faults. Use of sequence networks was extended to include SOP, such that conventional fault analysis technique can be used on a distribution network with SOP. A Fault-Index was defined using symmetrical components of voltages measured at the grid connection point of the SOP. The network performance was investigated under a line-to-ground, a line-to-line and a three-phase fault. The behaviour of the network was analysed under different control schemes and various operating scenarios of the SOP. Furthermore, the dependence of the sequence voltages and currents on the SOP set points was investigated. Simulations were carried out on an 11kV generic UK distribution network model developed in PSCAD/EMTDC. Results show that the convectional fault analysis technique is applicable on a network with SOP, regardless of the SOP control mode. The Fault-Index, defined based on the local voltage measurements, was effective in detecting the presence of an AC fault in the MV distribution network. In addition, the need for a non-current based detection method is illustrated.
