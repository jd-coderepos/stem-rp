The current research tackles the energy trilemma of emissions reduction, security of supply and cost savings in industrial environments by presenting the development of a packaged, plug & play power unit for low-grade waste heat recovery applications. The heat to power conversion system is based on the Trilateral Flash Cycle (TFC), a bottoming thermodynamic cycle particularly suitable for waste heat sources at temperatures below 100 °C which, on a European scale, account for 469 TWh in industry and are particularly concentrated in the chemical and petrochemical sectors. The industrial test case refers to a UK tire manufacturing company in which a 2 MW water stream at 85 °C involved in the rubber curing process was chosen as hot source of the TFC system while a pond was considered the heat sink. The design of the industrial scale power unit, which is presented at end of the manuscript, was carried out based on the outcomes of a theoretical modelling platform that allowed to investigate and optimize multiple design parameters using energy and exergy analyses. In particular, the model exploitation identified R1233zd(E) and R245fa as the most suitable pure working fluids for the current application, given the higher net power output and the lower ratio between pumping and expander powers. At nominal operating conditions, the designed TFC system is expected to recover 120 kWe and have an overall efficiency of 6%.
