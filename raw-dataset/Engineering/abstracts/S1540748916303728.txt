The near-wall behaviour of the generalised flame surface density (FSD) transport in the context of Reynolds Averaged Navierâ€“Stokes (RANS) simulations has been analysed for different values of global Lewis number using three-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data of head-on quenching of statistically planar turbulent premixed flames by an isothermal inert wall. It has been found that the statistical behaviour of the FSD based reaction rate closure and the terms of the FSD transport equation are significantly affected by the presence of the wall and by the global Lewis number. The near-wall predictions of the standard FSD based mean reaction rate closure and existing sub-models for the unclosed terms of the FSD transport equation have been found to be inadequate based on a-priori DNS assessment, and modifications to these models have been suggested so that the predictions of modified models for reaction rate closure and FSD transport remain satisfactory, both close to the wall and away from it over a wide range of global Lewis number.
