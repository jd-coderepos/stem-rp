This paper reports the results of an experimental investigation of the utilization of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) to concrete marine structures. The study involved testing reinforced concrete (RC) columns. A total of 32 specimens were grouped and investigated to evaluate the performance of CFRP wrapped RC circular columns in a marine environment. The specimens were immersed for different periods in crude oil or seawater, which are common conditions for marine structures. The specimens were identical and had a diameter of 150mm and an overall height of 550mm. Period of immersion was the main test parameter and the investigation focused on the performance of the columns wrapped with CFRP in terms of load capacity, deformation and ductility. The test results showed that the ultimate load capacity of the RC columns wrapped with CFRP was not noticeably affected by immersion in crude oil or seawater. However, there was a significant reduction in ultimate axial displacement and radial strain. Hence, there was a significant negative effect of immersion in crude oil or seawater on the ductility of RC columns confined with CFRP.
