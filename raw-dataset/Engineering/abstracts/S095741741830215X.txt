The aim of this study is to provide an overview the state-of-the-art elements of text classification. For this purpose, we first select and investigate the primary and recent studies and objectives in this field. Next, we examine the state-of-the-art elements of text classification. In the following steps, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyse the related works. Herein, we describe six baseline elements of text classification including data collection, data analysis for labelling, feature construction and weighing, feature selection and projection, training of a classification model, and solution evaluation. This study will help readers acquire the necessary information about these elements and their associated techniques. Thus, we believe that this study will assist other researchers and professionals to propose new studies in the field of text classification.
