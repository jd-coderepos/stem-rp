A joint experimental and computational study of thermoacoustic instabilities in a model swirl-stabilised combustor is presented. This paper aims to deliver a better characterisation of such instabilities through the examination of measurements in conjunction with the numerical results obtained via Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The experimental configuration features a cylindrical combustion chamber where the lean premixed methane/air flame experiences self-sustained thermoacoustic oscillations. The nonlinear behaviour of the acoustically excited flame is experimentally investigated by broadband chemiluminescence and dynamic pressure measurements. In LES, the Eulerian stochastic field method is employed for the unknown turbulence/chemistry interaction of the gas-phase. Comparisons of the predicted frequency spectrum and phase-resolved flame structure with measurements are found to be in good agreement, confirming the predictive capabilities of the LES methodology. The presence of Period 2 thermoacoustic oscillations, as a consequence of period-doubling bifurcation, is also confirmed in LES. Through the application of nonlinear analysis both to the experimental and numerical acoustic fluctuations, it is highlighted that the nonlinear behaviour of combustion instabilities in the burner under investigation follows a pattern typical of Period 2 oscillations. Furthermore, the current work demonstrates a useful approach, through the use of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), for the investigation of unstable flame modes at a specific frequency of interest. The experimental and numerical DMD reconstructions suggest that hot combustion products are convected azimuthally at a rate dictated by the subharmonic frequency.
