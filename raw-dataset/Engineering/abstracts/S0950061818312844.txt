To evaluate a restoration strategy for highly degraded marble structures, microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) has been employed to reduce porosity and permeability in a column filled with coarse crushed marble. A 3D X-ray tomography scan revealed the spatial variation in porosity throughout the column and tracer breakthrough curves, recorded at intervals during treatment, enabled derivation of core-scale fluid transport properties and their alteration by precipitating carbonate. Micro-continuum scale flow modelling based on the X-ray data indicated that treatment led to changes in the pore network structure with flow increasingly focused into a smaller number of faster flowing open channels.
