A geometrically nonlinear analysis of symmetric variable angle tow (VAT) composite plates under in-plane shear is investigated. The nonlinear von Karman governing differential equations are derived for postbuckling analysis of symmetric VAT plate structures which are subsequently solved using the differential quadrature method. The effect of in-plane extension-shear coupling on the buckling and postbuckling performance of VAT composite plates is investigated. The buckling and postbuckling behaviour of VAT plates under positive and negative shear is studied for different VAT fibre orientations, aspect ratios, combined axial compression and their performance is compared with that of straight fibre composites. It is shown that there can be enhanced shear buckling and postbuckling performance for both displacement-control and load-control and that the underpinning driving mechanics are different for each.
