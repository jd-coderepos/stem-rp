Static Var Compensators (SVC) have been widely used to separately improve each of voltage variation performance and steady state power factor of industrial substations. However, these two functions are interdependent, power factor improvement tends to do better voltage regulation. In this paper, a newly starting method with SVC for large induction motors is suggested. This method provides a controllable amount of reactive power precisely according to the requirement of the load. A combined controller consists of slow susceptance control besides fast acting voltage control will give SVC the ability to achieve power factor correction, and will present a constant voltage characteristic during large induction motor starting. An ideal compensator approach is proposed for both power factor correction and optimum voltage regulation. A case study of 1.4 MW large induction motor starting is presented with different starting methods. A comparative study is conducted to simulation results using Electrical Transient Analyzer Program (ETAP) for different starting cases. Finally, the simulation results provide bases for the safe and reliable operation and would insure a robust design of practical substation.
