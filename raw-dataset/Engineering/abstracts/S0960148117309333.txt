We report on the relative performances of two large-scale luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) noise barriers placed in an outdoor environment monitored for over a year. Comparisons are made for the performances of a number of attached photovoltaic cells with changing spectral illumination, cloud cover conditions and other seasonal variations, and the temperatures of the cells. Differences in performance are attributed to the positioning of the panels, whether facing North/South or East/West. In general, the panels facing East/West run cooler than those facing North/South. The LSCs in both orientations appear to perform more efficiently under lower light conditions: one factor contributing to this increased performance is better spectral matching of the solar spectrum under cloudy conditions to the absorption spectrum of the embedded fluorescent dye. This work is a step forward in the characterization of a large-scale LSC device, and suggests predictions of performance of devices could be made for any location given sufficient knowledge of the illumination conditions, and provides an important step towards the commercialization of these alternative solar energy generators for the urban setting.
