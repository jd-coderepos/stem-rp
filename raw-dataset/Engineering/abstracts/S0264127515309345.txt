Mild detonating fuse (MDF) plays a vital role in pyrotechnics separate devices. Energy output efficiency of MDF has significances to the structural design of pyrotechnics devices. A deformation cylinder tube testing set for small counts of explosive charge was developed to estimate energy output efficiency of MDF. Charge density and detonation velocity of MDF were measured experimentally. Detonation heat of MDF charge was calculated based on Kamlet equations and experimental results. Three kinds of copper tubes with uniform inner diameter and different outer diameters were used in the tests, which were loaded by the same MDF. Plastic strain energy of the copper tube was calculated by measuring the recycled tube. The results show that the range of energy output efficiency of MDF is 57.6%â€“60.0%. Furthermore, the experiments were simulated by dynamic finite element software LS-DYNA, and simulated deformation results of copper tube were consistent with experimental results. According to the simulated results, the plastic strain energy of copper tube and energy transform efficiency were investigated in detail. The results show that energy output efficiency of MDF is reduced with the increase of outer diameter of the copper tube, and nearly keeps unchangeable when enough elastic zone occurs in the tube.
