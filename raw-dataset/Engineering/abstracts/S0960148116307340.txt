The feasibility and sustainable operation of tidal lagoons and barrages has been under scrutiny over uncertainties with regards to their environmental impacts, potential interactions and energy output. A numerical modelling methodology that evaluates their effects on the hydro-environment has been refined to consider technical constraints and specifications associated with variable turbine designs and operational sequences. The method has been employed to assess a number of proposals and their combinations within the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary in the UK. Operational challenges associated with tidal range power plants are highlighted, while also presenting the capabilities of modelling tools tailored to their assessment. Results indicate that as the project scale increases so does its relative hydrodynamic impact, which may compromise annual energy output expectations if not accounted for. However, the manner in which such projects are operated can also have a significant impact on changing the local hydro-environment, including the ecology and morphology. Therefore, it is imperative that tidal range power plants are designed in such a way that efficiently taps into renewable energy sources, with minimal interference to the regional hydro-environment through their operation.
