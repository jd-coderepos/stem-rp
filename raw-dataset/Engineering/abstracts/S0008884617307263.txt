Quasi-instantaneous thermal expansion of cement pastes is governed by the relative humidity (RH) within their air-filled pores and by the decrease/increase of this internal RH resulting from a temperature decrease/increase. The latter effect is traced back to quasi-instantaneous water uptake/release by cement hydrates, using microporomechanics and a three-scale representation of mature cement pastes. Partially saturated gel and capillary pores are considered to be connected and spherical, with radii following exponential distributions. The Mori-Tanaka scheme provides the scale transition from effective pore pressures to eigenstrains at the cement paste level. This modeling approach, together with considering mass conservation of water, allows for downscaling macroscopic thermal expansion coefficients, so as to identify the molecular water uptake/release characteristics of the hydrates. The latter characteristics are mixture-independent, as shown by their use for predicting the thermal expansion coefficients of different mature cement pastes, with w/c-ratios ranging from 0.50 to 0.70.
