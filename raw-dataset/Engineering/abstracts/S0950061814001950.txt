Durability of asphalt mixtures conditioned in hot water was investigated using stiffness measurements. Stiffness generally decreased with conditioning time. The effect of moisture on stiffness was found to be reversible as moisture conditioned-asphalt mixtures that had lost up to 80% of their initial stiffness fully recovered upon subsequent drying. Estimates of mastic film thickness and length of diffusion paths obtained from image analysis of X-ray CT scans of the asphalt mixtures suggest moisture diffusion was mainly restricted to the bulk mastic. The results suggest cohesive rather than adhesive failure dominated the durability of asphalt mixtures under the long-term moisture exposure used in this study.
