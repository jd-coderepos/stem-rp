This paper presents the design, analysis and experimental verification of strut-based lattice structures to enhance the mechanical vibration isolation properties of a machine frame, whilst also conserving its structural integrity. In addition, design parameters that correlate lattices, with fixed volume and similar material, to natural frequency and structural integrity are also presented. To achieve high efficiency of vibration isolation and to conserve the structural integrity, a trade-off needs to be made between the frameâ€™s natural frequency and its compressive strength. The total area moment of inertia and the mass (at fixed volume and with similar material) are proposed design parameters to compare and select the lattice structures; these parameters are computationally efficient and straight-forward to compute, as opposed to the use of finite element modelling to estimate both natural frequency and compressive strength. However, to validate the design parameters, finite element modelling has been used to determine the theoretical static and dynamic mechanical properties of the lattice structures. The lattices have been fabricated by laser powder bed fusion and experimentally tested to compare their static and dynamic properties to the theoretical model. Correlations between the proposed design parameters, and the natural frequency and strength of the lattices are presented.
