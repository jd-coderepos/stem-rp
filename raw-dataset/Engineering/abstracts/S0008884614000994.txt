A numerical model for the growth of amorphous quasi-two-dimensional structures in three-dimensional confinements is presented. Application of this model to the formation of calcium–silicate–hydrates by reaction of anhydrous cement and water, within the interstitial pore space of cement grains, leads to structures with growth and morphological properties consistent with a range of experimental data.
