Finite element models, using the eigenstrain approach, are described that predict the residual stress fields associated with laser shock peening (LSP) applied to aerospace grade aluminium alloys. The model was used to explain the results of laboratory fatigue experiments, containing different LSP patch geometries, supplementary stress raising features and different specimen thickness. It is shown that interactions between the LSP process and geometric features are the key to understanding the subsequent fatigue strength. Particularly relevant for engineering application, is the fact that not all instances of LSP application provided an improvement in fatigue performance. Although relatively deep surface compressive residual stresses are generated which can resist fatigue crack initiation in these regions, a balancing tensile stress will always exist and its location must be carefully considered.
