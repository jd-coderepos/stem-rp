Experimental attempts of ignition of sensitive explosive atmospheres by continuous positive corona discharges in coaxial electrode system were conducted in laboratory conditions. Sixty five explosions of hydrogen (H2) and forty of carbon disulphide (CS2) were forced. Both atmospheres were ignited by the minimum power 1–2 W, the minimum ignition current 100–130 μA at the ignition voltages 12–30 kV (for CS2) and 16.5–25 kV (H2). To prevent the energetic sparks, the high voltage resistor 1 MΩ was introduced in series with corona wire.
