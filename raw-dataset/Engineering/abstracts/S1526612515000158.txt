AISI Type 304L austenitic stainless steels are extensively used in industries, and welding is an indispensable tool used for joining these materials. In a multi-pass weld, the development of residual stress to a large extent depends on the response of the weld metal, heat affected zone and parent material to complex thermo-mechanical cycles during welding. Earlier researchers on this area used either mechanical tensioning or heat treatment to modify the residual stress distribution in and around the weld. In this research, microstructural refinement with modification of residual stress state was attempted by using high pressure cold rolling followed by laser processing in 12mm thick 304L austenitic stainless steels which is a novel technique. The hardening of the weld metal was evaluated after welding, post weld cold rolling, and post weld cold rolling followed by laser processing. The residual stress was determined non-destructively by using neutron diffraction. Residual stress analysis show that post weld cold rolling was effective in modifying the longitudinal residual stress distribution throughout the entire thickness. Post weld cold rolling followed by laser processing performed in this research was to induce recrystallization of the cold rolled grains. However, post weld cold rolling followed by laser processing showed minor grain refinement but was not effective as it reinstated the stress state.
