In this paper, cement combinations based on calcium sulfoaluminate cement (CSAC) were developed and the effect of fly ash and the hemihydrate form of calcium sulfate on the properties of the systems was studied. Fly ash (FA), anhydrite (ANH), flue-gas desulfurization gypsum (FGDG) and plaster gypsum (PL) were used to develop appropriate CSAC/calcium sulfate and CSAC/calcium sulfate/addition systems, the hydration of which was studied. Tested properties of cements were the compressive strength and the setting times. The results suggest that the use of fly ash in the presence of anhydrite accelerates the formation of a strong ettringite-rich matrix that firmly accommodated unreacted fly ash particles, both synergistically contributing to a dense microstructure. At a given sulfate content, the use of anhydrite was shown to be favourable in terms of the setting times, heat patterns and strength development compared to the hemihydrate-based formulations.
