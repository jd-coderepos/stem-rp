In dense mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs), a number of major applications require monitoring of the geographical boundaries of sensor readings among physical phenomena with as low traffic as possible. In this paper, we propose a periodical boundary detection method reducing traffic by exchanging sensor data only among nodes near the boundaries. Our proposed method achieves this by incorporating recording the time when a node has crossed the boundary and overhearing sensor data. We confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed method through simulation experiments.
