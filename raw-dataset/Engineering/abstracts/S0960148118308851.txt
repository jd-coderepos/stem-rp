Low heat loss vacuum glazing offers high heat insulation for indoor space, which reduces the buildingâ€™s heating energy demand. However, the transparent nature of this glazing allows similar daylight to double glazing that creates discomfort glare. Double pane semi-transparent type photovoltaic (PV) glazing introduces control of solar heat gain, daylight and generates clean electricity. The transparent portion between regularly distributed PV cells allows light penetration. Addition of these two technologies can offer low heat loss PV-vacuum glazing that will control heat loss, heat gain, and daylight and generate renewable power. In this work, two different areas of multicrystalline PV cells were employed to form 35% and 42% transparent PV-vacuum glazing. Spectral characterisation, glazing factor and entering light quality through the transparent part of this PV-vacuum glazing were evaluated. Colour rendering and correlated colour temperature of this glazing were compared with an electrically actuated switchable suspended particle device glazing.
