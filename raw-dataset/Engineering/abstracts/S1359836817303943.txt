An experimental work on reinforced concrete (RC) rectangular beams strengthened in shear with textile reinforced mortar (TRM) jackets is presented in this paper, with focus on the following investigated parameters: (a) the amount of external TRM reinforcement ratio, ρ f , by means of using different number of textile layers and different types of textile fibre materials (carbon, glass, basalt); (b) the textile geometry, and (c) the shear span-to-depth ratio, a/d. In total, 22 tests were conducted on simply supported rectangular RC beams under (three-point bending) monotonic loading. The experimental results revealed that: (1) TRM is very effective when the failure is attributed to debonding of the TRM jacket from the concrete substrate; (2) the trend of effective strains for carbon, glass and basalt TRM jackets is descending for increasing values of the TRM reinforcement ratio, ρ f , when failure is associated to debonding of the jacket; (3) the effect of textile geometry is significant only for low values of ρ f , resulting in variances in the capacity enhancement and the failure modes, and (4) the shear span-to-depth ratio has practically no effect to the failure mode nor to the TRM jacket contribution to the total shear resistance of the RC beams.
