The pressure load at a vertical barrier caused by extreme wave run-up is analysed numerically, using the conformal mapping method to solve the two-dimensional free surface Euler equations in a pseudo-spectral model. Previously this problem has been examined in the case of a flat-bottomed geometry. Here, the model is extended to consider a varying bathymetry. Numerical experiments show that an increasing step-like bottom profile may enhance the extreme run-up of long waves but result in a reduced pressure load.
