Demineralized bone allografts and mesenchymal stromal cells have been used to promote bone regeneration. However, the degree to which cortical bone should be demineralized for use in combination with adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (Ad-MSCs) remains to be clarified. In this study, the in vitro osteogenic ability of Ad-MSCs on allografts was investigated in relation to the extent of demineralization. Three treatment groups were established by varying exposure time to 0.6 N HCL: partially demineralized (PDB; 12 h), fully demineralized (FDB; 48 h), and non-demineralized bone (NDB; 0 h, as a control). Allografts were prepared as discs 6 mm in diameter for in vitro evaluation, and their demineralization and structure were evaluated by micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy. Ad-MSC adhesion and proliferation were measured by MTS assay, and osteogenesis-related gene expression was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. PDB and FDB demineralization rates were 57.13 and 92.30%, respectively. Moreover, Ad-MSC adhesion rates on NDB, PDB, and FDB were 53.41, 60.65, and 61.32%, respectively. Proliferation of these cells on FDB increased significantly after 2 days of culture compared to the other groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, expression of the osteogenic genes ALP, BMP-7, and TGF-Î² in the FDB group on culture day 3 was significantly elevated in comparison to the other treatments. Given its biocompatibility and promotion of the osteogenic differentiation of Ad-MSCs, our results suggest that FDB may be a suitable scaffold for use in the repair of bone defects.
