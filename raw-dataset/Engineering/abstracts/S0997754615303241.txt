Pressure driven steady flow through a uniform circular channel containing a constricted portion is a common problem considering physiological flows such as underlying human speech sound production. The influence of the constriction’s cross-section shape (circle, ellipse, circular sector) on the flow within and downstream from the constriction is experimentally quantified. An analytical boundary layer flow model is proposed which takes into account the hydraulic diameter of the cross-section shape. Comparison of the model outcome with experimental and three-dimensional numerically simulated flow data shows that the pressure distribution within the constriction can be modeled accurately so that the model is of interest for analytical models of fluid–structure interaction without the assumption of two-dimensional flow.
