Solar-battery systems are still expensive, bulky, and space consuming. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel device that combines all the components of a solar-battery system in one device. This device might help reduce installation cost compared to the current solar-battery systems as well as provide a plug-and-play solution. However, this physical integration means higher temperatures for the components. Therefore, this paper presents a thermal analysis of the physical integration concept to evaluate its feasibility, focusing on the batteries, the most delicate components. The thermal analysis was conducted using a Finite Element Method model and validated with experimental results on a prototype. According to the model, the temperature of the components (battery and converters) reduced drastically by adding an air gap of 5–7 cm between the solar panel and the components. Even under severe conditions, maximum battery temperature never surpassed the highest temperature of operation defined by the manufacturer. Moreover, the maximum battery temperature decreases even further by applying a phase change material as a passive cooling method, reducing it by 5 °C. As a result, the battery pack operates in a safe range when combined with a 265 Wp solar panel, demonstrating the potential of this concept for future solar-battery applications.
