While global sea level has risen by 20cm since the mid-19th century, the role of this process in present-day and past shoreline mobility is still debated. In this paper, we review previous studies that explored the relations between sea-level rise and shoreline changes over the last few decades. Existing methods can be classified into two groups: (1) approaches based on the analysis of trends and variability in shoreline change observations, which investigate whether a correlation with the temporal or spatial patterns sea level changes can be established; and (2) approaches based on the comparison of shoreline observations with a coastal model outcome, which attempt to evaluate the contribution of sea-level rise to shoreline mobility using coastal evolution modeling tools. The existing applications of these methods face two common difficulties: first, shoreline data are often lacking or insufficiently resolved temporally to capture the dynamics of coastlines; and second, relative sea level along the coast is generally only known in a limited number of areas where tide gauges are available. These two challenges can be met, owing to the increasing amount of shoreline change observations and complementary geodetic techniques. The wide range of different interpretations regarding the role of sea-level rise in recent shoreline changes highlights the necessity to conduct specific studies that rely on local observations and models applicable in the local geomorphological context.
