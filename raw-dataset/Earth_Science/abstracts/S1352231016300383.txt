Decaying leaves from Arctic regions have previously been reported to produce large numbers of ice nucleating particles (IN). Their atmospheric relevance is unclear. Our initial observations at a coastal mountain observatory in northern Norway reveal a tripling in concentrations of IN active at −15 °C (IN-15) in oceanic air after about one day of passage over land (from 1.7 and 4.9 IN-15 m−3, to 9.6 and 12.2 IN-15 m−3). Analysis of leaf litter collected near the observatory supports the earlier report of numerous IN associated with leaf litter on the ground (2 ⋅ 102 IN-15 μg−1 litter particles < 5 μm). Together, both findings suggest that decaying leaves are a strong emission source of IN to the Arctic boundary layer.
