Airborne radiation monitoring was conducted in order to evaluate the influence of radionuclides emitted by the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident throughout Japan. Carrying out airborne radiation monitoring using manned and unmanned helicopters, the we have developed and established an analysis method concurrently with the development of this monitoring method. In particular, because the background radiation level differs greatly between East and West regions of Japan, we have developed a discrimination method for natural radionuclide and cosmic rays using the gamma energy spectra. The reliability of the airborne radiation monitoring data was validated through comparison with large amounts of ground measurement data. The ecological half-lives of short and long components for decline of the ambient dose equivalent (air dose rate) were 0.61 years and 57 years, respectively, based on the results of air dose rate of airborne radiation monitoring using manned helicopter. These results indicate the importance of airborne monitoring to evaluate and predict the radiation exposure of residents.
