Legislation addressing environmental, health and safety aspects of nanomaterials in consumer products and ensuring their safe use is being continuously updated in the European Union and globally. This leads to a growing need for tools to implement this developing legislation. A freely accessible inventory of ready-to-use and publicly available tools that together cover the tasks within a nanomaterial safety assessment process was built in the presented work. This inventory is a unique metadata set in Excel® format: the ‘NANoREG Toolbox’, which assembles information needed for selecting and accessing instruments that meet specific goals. The recorded tools are categorised according to their purpose, type and regulatory status. The Toolbox covers an unprecedented and broad range of over 500 current tools, developed in Europe and beyond. While NANoREG focussed on safety assessment under the EU Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the instruments in the Toolbox are relevant and useful for nanomaterial safety assessments worldwide.
