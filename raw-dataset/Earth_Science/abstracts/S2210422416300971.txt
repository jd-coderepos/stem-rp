The innovation systems approach offers a framework to identify what inhibits the generation, diffusion and implementation of innovations. It prescribes that interventions should target systemic problems that inhibit the system from functioning well. In current literature, systemic problems are typically identified independent from each other, after which interventions are formulated for each one separately. The following will argue that, next to the problems themselves, also the interactions between the problems are of key importance when designing intervention strategies. We analyze the Dutch energy-efficient housing innovation system and conclude that neglecting interactions between systemic problems may not only lead to inaccurate problem diagnosis, but also to ineffective or even counterproductive interventions.
