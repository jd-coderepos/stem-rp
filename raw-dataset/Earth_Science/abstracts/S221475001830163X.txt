The present study was taken up to evaluate the single dose acute toxicity, 28 days and 90 days repeated dose toxicity and reproductive/developmental toxicity of standardized 40% Garcinol in experimental rodents. The studies were conducted in compliance with OECD principles of good laboratory practice, guidelines for testing of chemicals no.420, 407, 408 and 421 respectively. Single dose acute oral toxicity was conducted on female Wistar rats as sighting study step-I (300 mg/kg) & sighting study step-II (2000 mg/kg) and main study (2000 mg/kg). Sub-acute, sub-chronic and reproductive/developmental studies were conducted in Wistar rats divided equally in vehicle control, 20, 50 and 100 mg/kg dose group along with recovery groups for vehicle control and high dose. Reproductive/developmental study was carried out for minimum of 28 days and in females during pregnancy and 4 days post partum. There were no abnormal clinical signs/behavioural changes, reproductive and developmental parameters, gross and histopathological changes as well as no alteration in the body weight, body temperature, haematology and other biochemical parameters in all the four studies. 40% Garcinol has a low toxicity profile in rodents and had no observed effects under experimental conditions used.
