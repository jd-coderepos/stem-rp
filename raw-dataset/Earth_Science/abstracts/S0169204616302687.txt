Guidelines for trip and parking generation in the United States come mainly from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). However, their trip and parking manuals focus on suburban locations with limited transit and pedestrian access. This study aims to determine how many fewer vehicle trips are generated at transit-oriented developments (TODs), and how much less parking is required at TODs, than ITE guidelines would suggest. Our sample of TODs is small, which limits our ability to generalize. However, the five cases selected for this study are more or less exemplary of the D variables, at least in comparison with US norms. They are characterized by land-use diversity and pedestrian-friendly designs. They minimize distance to transit, literally abutting transit stations. They have varying measures of destination accessibility to the rest of the region via transit. Three have progressive parking policies, which fall under the heading of demand management. Two have high residential densities, and one has a high intensity of commercial development. Simply put, our case study TODs create significantly less demand for parking and driving than do conventional suburban developments. With one exception, peak parking demand in these TODs is less than one half the parking supply guideline in the ITE Parking Generation manual. Also, with one exception, vehicle trip generation rates are about half or less of what is predicted in the ITE Trip Generation Manual. Automobile mode shares are as low as one quarter of all trips, with the remainder being mostly transit and walk trips.
