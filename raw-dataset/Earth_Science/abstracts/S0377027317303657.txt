Using a three-dimensional fluid dynamic model for eruption cloud dynamics, we present numerical simulations of the development of a volcanic eruption column and umbrella cloud formed during the 13 February 2014 eruptions of Mount Kelud, Indonesia. The model used in this study quantitatively reproduces the observed data and, in particular, the plume height and the horizontal expansion level and rate of the umbrella cloud. The simulation results suggest that on the basis of the plume height and structures and the horizontal expansion level of the umbrella cloud the mass eruption rate (MER) for the 2014 Kelud eruptions was 3×107 to 4×107 kgs−1. On the basis of the horizontal expansion rate of the umbrella cloud, on the other hand, the estimated MER was 1×108 kgs−1. The difference between these two estimates implies the strong diffusion in the umbrella cloud or the efficient entrainment of ambient air by eruption column.
