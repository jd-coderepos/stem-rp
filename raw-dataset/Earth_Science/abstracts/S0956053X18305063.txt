In view of the increasing demand of organic agriculture, utilization of waste and environmental protection, sericulture focuses not only on the cocoon production, but also on other ways that can benefit the farmâ€™s economy. It is necessary to find new sources of income for small-scale farmers not only through cocoon selling, but also by the multiple uses of by-products. Insect farming technology provides a cheap source of biomass, which may be a good material in biogas production. Studies showed that the examined substrates, both silkworm breeding waste and caterpillar excreta, generate a biogas yield comparable to other substrates of agricultural origin, such as cattle, pig and chicken manures. Fermentation of silkworm excreta under mesophilic conditions produces 167.32 m3/Mg TS of methane and 331.97 m3/Mg TS of biogas, while fermentation of silkworm breeding waste yields 256.59 m3/Mg TS of methane and 489.24 m3/Mg TS of biogas. Moreover, the chemical composition of these raw materials was analyzed.
