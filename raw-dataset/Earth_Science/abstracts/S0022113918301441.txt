Herein, a series of aromatic pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5) containing amino acids are reported. A Negishi cross-coupling strategy utilising a catalyst system of Pd(dba)2 and SPhos afforded the aforementioned SF5 amino acids in yields between 32% and 42%. Two dipeptides utilising both the amine and carboxylic functionalities of the synthesised SF5 containing amino acids were prepared, demonstrating their compatibility with common amide/peptide coupling reagents and strategies.
