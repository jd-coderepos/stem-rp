In March 2014, Mexico launched its CCUS technology roadmap, outlining the actions to be taken up to 2024. One important action is the National Policy of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) ready and the identification of priority natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) with capture plants. This outcome could aid the creation of a technology roadmap for the design of new NGCC power plants and their operational requirements for EOR and for the reduction of CO2 emissions. This article provides an overview of the opportunities for deploying CCS in new NGCC power plants in Mexico which were programed to begin operation throughout the period from 2016 to 2030. The attention is given to plants close to oil fields which are candidates for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), located in an inclusion zone suitable for storage. The Gulf of Mexico region, where potential EOR sites and the presence of industrial CO2 sources are located, is within the inclusion zone for recommended sites for geological storage of CO2. After identifying new power plants in the inclusion zone, this article analyses which existing plants could be retrofitted and which new power plants could be designed to be ‘carbon capture ready’. In addition, the distance and the volumes of CO2 are estimated.
