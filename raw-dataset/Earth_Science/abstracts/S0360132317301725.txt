Previous research indicated that the surface-averaged forced convective heat transfer coefficient (CHTC) at a windward building facade can vary substantially as a function of building width and height. However, existing CHTC expressions generally do not consider the building dimensions as parameters and are therefore strictly only applicable for the building geometry for which they were derived. Most CHTC expressions also categorize facades only as either windward or leeward. This indicates the need for new and more generally applicable CHTC expressions. This paper presents new generalized expressions for surface-averaged forced CHTC at building facades and roofs that contain the reference wind speed, the width and the height of the windward building facade as parameters. These expressions are derived from CFD simulations of wind flow and forced convective heat transfer for 81 different isolated buildings. The 3D Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved with a combination of the high-Re number realizable k-ε model and the low-Re number Wolfshtein model. First, a validation study is performed with wind-tunnel measurements of surface temperature for a reduced-scale cubic model. Next, the actual simulations are performed on a high-resolution grid with a minimum near-wall cell size of 400 μm to resolve the entire boundary layer, including the viscous sublayer and the buffer layer, which dominate the convective surface resistance. The new CHTC expressions are analytical formulae (trivariate polynomials) that can easily be implemented in Building Energy Simulation (BES) and Building Envelope Heat-Air-Moisture (BE-HAM) transfer programs. The accuracy of the expressions is confirmed by in-sample and out-of-sample evaluations.
