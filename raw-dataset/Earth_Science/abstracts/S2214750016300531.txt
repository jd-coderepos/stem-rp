Objective A major class of synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, deltamethrin (DM), can elicit pathophysiological effects through oxidative stress in non-targeted organisms such as mammals. There is accumulating evidence that virgin olive oil (VOO), a rich source of polyphenolic components, have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. This study aimed to determine the protective and ameliorative effects of VOO against DM-induced nephrotoxicity. Methods & materials Mice were randomly divided into four equal groups: DM group, DM plus VOO group, VOO group, and vehicle group. Five weeks after gavaging, kidney samples were taken for biochemical assessment of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT), and for immunohistochemical assessment of caspase-3, cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Results The MDA level in kidney was increased in the DM group, which was significantly decreased after VOO administration in the DM plus VOO group. The GSH level and CAT activiy in kidney were decreased in the DM group, which were significantly increased after VOO administration in the DM plus VOO group. Greater expression of caspase-3, cox-2, and PARP could be detected in the DM group, which was significantly attenuated in the DM plus VOO group. Also, the histopathological changes which were detected in the DM group attenuated after VOO consumption. Conclusion Virgin olive oil exerted protective effects against deltamethrin-induced nephrotoxicity, which might be associated with its anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative properties.
