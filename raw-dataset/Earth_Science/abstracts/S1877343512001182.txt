In the past decade, there has been growing evidence that activities to mitigate climate change can have beneficial impacts on public health as a result of changes to environmental pollutants and health-related behaviours. Urban settlements provide particular opportunities to help achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and thus associated health benefits. Energy efficiency improvements in housing can help protect against the adverse health effects of low and high temperatures and outdoor air pollution; transport interventions, especially ones that entail increased walking and cycling, can help improve physical activity and the urban environment; and switching to low carbon fuels to generate electricity can reduce air pollution-related health burdens. However, interventions need to be carefully designed and implemented to maximize health benefits and minimize potential adverse health risks.
