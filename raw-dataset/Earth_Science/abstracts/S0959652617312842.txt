This paper proposes a robustness analysis based on Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA). The ensuing model was used to assess the implementation of green chemistry principles in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. Its recommendations were also compared to an earlier developed model for the same purpose to investigate concordance between the models and potential decision support synergies. A three-phase procedure was adopted to achieve the research objectives. Firstly, an ordinal ranking of the evaluation criteria used to characterize the implementation of green chemistry principles was identified through relative ranking analysis. Secondly, a structured selection process for an MCDA classification method was conducted, which ensued in the identification of Stochastic Multi-Criteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA). Lastly, the agreement of the classifications by the two MCDA models and the resulting synergistic role of decision recommendations were studied. This comparison showed that the results of the two models agree between 76% and 93% of the simulation set-ups and it confirmed that different MCDA models provide a more inclusive and transparent set of recommendations. This integrative research confirmed the beneficial complementary use of MCDA methods to aid responsible development of nanosynthesis, by accounting for multiple objectives and helping communication of complex information in a comprehensive and traceable format, suitable for stakeholders and/or decision-makers with diverse backgrounds.
