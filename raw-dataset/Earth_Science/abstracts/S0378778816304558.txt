Buildings have in recent years been the target of a number of energy efficiency improvement strategies given that they are a major energy end-use sector in most countries. Whilst new buildings due to legislations, increasingly address sustainability and improved energy efficiency considerations, the refurbishment process of older buildings still presents a number of challenges. Advancement in Information and Communication Technology, particularly the application of low-cost Wireless Sensors and Actuators Network does however provide the opportunity to harness yet unrealized energy reduction in existing buildings. This paper presents results from an experimental study evaluating the performance and energy saving potentials of such off-the-shelve, low-cost wireless sensors and actuators network in an existing office building for occupancy detection and occupancy-driven lighting control. The study demonstrates that in addition to improved occupancy information obtainable from Wireless Sensors and Actuators Network, worthwhile savings in the energy consumption of the lighting systems can as well be achieved.
