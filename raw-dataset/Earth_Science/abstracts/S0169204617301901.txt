Cross-sectional methods were utilized to investigate if greenspace (GS) exposure predicts stress, a known factor affecting health outcomes. Data included publicly accessible Community Statistical Area (CSA) level information and survey (mailed and online) results of residents in Baltimore, Maryland. The convenience sample was recruited in spring 2013 using random (by CSA) and snowball techniques. The survey included demographic information, GS exposure, recent stressful life events, and the validated Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Individuals reported (hours per week, type) where they see (visual exposure) or spend time in (physical exposure) GS around their home, work and/or school, and during recreation. Duration of GS exposure was defined as hours of visual exposure, hours of physical exposure, and total hours of exposure (both visual and physical). Multivariable linear regression assessed the effect of GS on perceived stress. Respondents (N=323) reported a mean 25.5 total hours/week exposed to GS. Mean PSS scores were 15.75 for females and 13.45 for males. Controlling for all covariates, there was a statistically significant reduction in PSS score (0.049, p=0.007) for every hour/week exposed to GS. This means that an individual who spent 25.5h/week exposed to GS would have a PSS score 3.1% lower than those who were not exposed to GS. Total hours/week exposed to GS, and the individual effects of visual and physical exposure were all statistically significant. These findings indicate the stress reducing effects of GS exposure may be part of complex set of factors behind the relationship between GS and health outcomes.
