The seeds germination, stem and root elongation of water lettuces (Lactuca sativa L) were used to evaluate the phytotoxicity of water and soil of Champotón River, Campeche, Mexico. water and soil sample were collected from two sampling sites. Lettuce seeds were exposed to three different dilutions of water and aqueous extract of soil. Significant differences on germination, root and stem elongation of lettuce were detected. Water showed more phytotoxic effect than aqueous extract of soil and inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) for radicle exposed to river water was 52% while stem elongation was 69%. Due to paucity the previously available phytotoxicological studies onto Champotón River, it is now essential to allocate time and resources to consider development of suitable chronic phytotoxicity tests.
