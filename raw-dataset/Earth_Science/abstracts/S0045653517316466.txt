Limonene oxidation products (LOPs) have gained interest on their harmful health effects over time. Recently, studies have shown that the selected LOPs: 4-oxopentanal (4-OPA), 3-isopropenyl-6-oxo-heptanal (IPOH) and 4-acetyl-1-methylcyclohexene (4-AMCH) have sensory irritation effects in mice and inflammatory effects in human lung cells. This study was therefore undertaken to investigate the potential capacity of 4-OPA, IPOH and 4-AMCH to cause cell membrane damage, oxidative stress and inflammation in human bronchial (16HBE14o-) and alveolar (A549) epithelial cell lines. Overall results suggest that 4-OPA, IPOH have cytotoxic effects on human lung cells that might be mediated by ROS: the highest concentration applied of IPOH [500 μM] enhanced ROS generation by 100-fold ± 7.7 (A549) and 230-fold ± 19.9 (16HBE14o-) compared to the baseline. 4-OPA [500 μM] increased ROS levels by 1.4-fold ± 0.3 (A549) and by 127-fold ± 10.5 (16HBE14o-), while treatment with 4-AMCH [500 μM] led to 0.9-fold ± 0.2 (A549) and 49-fold ± 12.8 (16HBE14o-) increase. IPOH [500 μM] caused a decrease in the thiol-state balance (e.g. after 2 h, GSH:GSSG was reduced by 37% compared to the untreated 16HBE14o-cells). 4-OPA [500 μM] decreased the GSH:GSSG by 1.3-fold change in A549 cells and 1.4-fold change in 16HBE14o-cells. No statistically significant decrease in the GSH:GSSG in A549 and 16HBE14o-cell lines was observed for 4-AMCH [500 μM]. In addition, IPOH and 4-OPA [31.2 μM] increased the amount of the inflammatory markers: RANTES, VEGF and EGF. On the other hand, 4-AMCH [31.2 μM] did not show inflammatory effects in A549 or 16HBE14o-cells. The 4-OPA, IPOH and 4-AMCH treatment concentration and time-dependently induce oxidative stress and/or alteration of inflammatory markers on human bronchial and alveolar cell lines.
