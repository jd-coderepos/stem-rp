We review the literature (2007â€“2016) on the quality of sustainability decisions and we introduce an integrative conceptual framework that distinguishes between a beneficial and a detrimental path that explain the influence of stakeholder diversity on the comprehensiveness of sustainability decisions. We argue that decision quality increases when stakeholder interest diversity is expressed through task conflict (extensive information sharing and exploration). Decision quality is compromised if stakeholder diversity is suppressed and false consensus occurs, that is, when task conflict is not tolerated or when decision makers fail to acknowledge and work with their differences. We conclude by discussing three generic recommendations that focus on inclusive stakeholder selection, norms for engagement and process consultation as ways of developing constructive collaboration in multiparty systems.
