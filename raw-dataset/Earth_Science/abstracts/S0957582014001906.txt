An important consideration for any new nuclear build programme is an understanding of the public's viewpoint, as in many countries this can influence the direction of future energy markets. This paper presents a first attempt at understanding public views on the design of new nuclear plants. A survey of 1304 adults in the UK was carried out using a questionnaire developed in this research. The study suggests that the general public are willing and able to express preferences for design aspects of nuclear power plants and that meaningful information can be obtained to inform designers. Responses indicate that public preferences are consistent with current design practice for nuclear power plants. Further analysis reveals that public preferences related to plant design are not influenced strongly by their existing attitudes. Our findings contribute to the literature on the governance of energy supply technologies and the involvement of the public in the innovation process. We argue that involving the public in the design of nuclear power plants is an important aspect of a more transparent, participatory approach intended to improve trust in the governance of future energy supply options.
