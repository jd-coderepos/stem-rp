A spatially explicit, two-pool soil phosphorus (P) model was used to analyze cropland P dynamics and fertilizer demand based on future crop production as projected in the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The model was initialized with historical data on P inputs and uptake, which governed the soil P accumulation up to present day. In contrast to existing scenario studies, the model accounts for both soil characteristics relevant to P retention and changing land use. At the global scale, crop uptake and the fraction of the applied P fertilizer that is directly taken up by plant roots govern the P quantities present in the soil. Despite the differences in the storylines among the SSPs, the quantitative implementation results in estimates for crop production and P inputs that are quite similar, which contrasts with the stark divergence in terms of population and incomes. In addition to global fertilizer P inputs in croplands increasing from 14.5 Tg P yr−1 in 2005 to 22–27 Tg P yr−1 in 2050, this study also estimates that 4–12 Tg P yr−1 would be needed in 2050 in global intensively managed grasslands to maintain fertility. Our new model approach can pinpoint the contribution of area expansion and crop yield improvement toward the total production, whereby the latter is shown to contribute 100% to 69%, depending on the scenario.
