Commercial office buildings represent the largest in floor area in most developed countries and utilize substantial amount of energy in the provision of building services to satisfy occupantsâ€™ comfort needs. This makes office buildings a target for occupant-driven demand control measures, which have been demonstrated as having huge potential to improve energy efficiency. The application of occupant-driven demand control measures in buildings, most especially in the control of thermal, visual and indoor air quality providing systems, which account for over 30% of the energy consumed in a typical office building is however hampered due to the lack of comprehensive fine-grained occupancy information. Given that comprehensive fine-grained occupancy information improves the performance of demand-driven measures, this paper presents a review of common existing systems utilized in buildings for occupancy detection. Furthermore, experimental results from the performance evaluation of chair sensors in an office building for providing fine-grained occupancy information for demand-driven control applications are presented.
