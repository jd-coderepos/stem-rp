Hundreds of compositionally diverse volcanoes have erupted on the Turkish–Iranian Plateau in the last 15Myr, attributed to one or more of the processes of Middle Miocene Tethyan slab break-off, localised lithospheric delamination and small-scale convection. Magmatism post-dates the initial Late Eocene or Early Oligocene Arabia–Eurasia collision by >10Myr. By contrast, in the east of the plateau in Eastern Iran there has been intermittent magmatism from the Late Oligocene to the Quaternary. Magma types include alkali basalt flows and scoria cones and adakite-like intermediate–felsic lavas and domes. New elemental and Nd–Sr–Pb–Hf isotope data from Quaternary mafic alkaline flows near Quchan in the Meshkan area in the NE of the country are combined with existing data from Miocene–Quaternary volcanic centres in the Binalud Range and the Nayband/Neh Fault zones. These mafic, incompatible element-enriched rocks, with positive Nb–Ta anomalies, are OIB-like and are argued to have formed by low-degree melting of a heterogeneous mantle source which contained DMM- and EMII-like components. At least some of the melting took place in the garnet stability field. Significant crustal contamination during magma ascent is recognised in the Nayband/Neh samples. Penecontemporaneous adakite-like rocks are argued to be high-pressure fractionates of basaltic melts which may have a separate source to the OIB-like basalts. Late Cenozoic mantle melting was aided by (1) localised extension and (2) enhanced small-scale asthenospheric convection related to Makran subduction, low mantle viscosity owing to the prior Tethyan subduction history of the region, and possibly edge-driven convection on the margin of the thickened Zagros lithosphere.
