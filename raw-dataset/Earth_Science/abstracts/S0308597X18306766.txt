Network governance signifies a move towards plural modes of governing, where informal, flexible and adaptive collaborative structures are emphasized to govern policy complexities. These are viewed as fostering efficient and innovative governance responses. The aim of this article is to contribute to the understanding of the operative features of this system, relative to its capacity to govern BSR challenges. This article suggests that BSR network governance is ill equipped to effectively govern policy complexities from a functional perspective. Although BSR networks operating space is congruent with the problem space, their operational cooperation space is limited by internal horizontal interactions. Networks are unprepared for routinized cross-sector and cross-level cooperation, with the view to expand the problem solving capacity. Cooperation across networks, which could integrate the distributed capacities of BSR policy-making, occurs on an ad-hoc basis and is guided by temporal projects. Projects are normative responses to enable cooperation across networks. BSR network based governance accentuates temporal governance features. It represents a move towards short-termism, advancing non-permanent features, which is at odds with longer-term activities and policy objectives required by BSR challenges. BSR project proliferation decreases the transparency and expands the temporal differentiation, contributing to a desynchronization and a fragmentation in the region. The result is less transparent network governance, causing friction in relation to the stability, coherence and continuity of activities. This not only hampers the efforts to coordinate cooperation activities; it is also detrimental when attempting to govern the complex policy challenges of the region.
