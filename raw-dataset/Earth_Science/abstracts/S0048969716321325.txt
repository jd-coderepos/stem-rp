The Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum), an invasive species in Northern Europe, can be used as a bioindicator of metal pollution. Seasonal effects on metallothionein (MT) production have not been considered in this species at the northernmost extent of its European distribution. This study assesses the annual seasonal effects on MT and metal concentrations in R. philippinarum from Poole Harbour, UK. R. philippinarum were collected in winter, spring, summer, and autumn throughout 2015, and MT and metal concentrations, as well as biotic and abiotic variables, were quantified. During winter, linear regression analysis showed significant positive relationships between tissue metal and MT concentrations. However, during spring and summer, these relationships were mostly insignificant. MT concentrations during spring had significant positive relationships with tissue and whole weight. Significant positive relationships were also observed between MT and condition index, during summer. During spring and summer, biotic factors seem to override the role of MT as a detoxification mechanism for metal exposure in this species. This is probably due to an increase in MT concentration in spring caused by gametogenesis, associated with increased tissue weight as the gonads expand. A depletion of energy resources, or physical stressors such as heat, may be attributed to the reduced MT production in clams of poor body condition in summer. The evidence from this study suggests that MT may only be a useful biomarker of metal pollution during winter in R. philippinarum in the UK. This verifies the natural variability of MT in this species at high latitudes, and highlights the potential and limits to a widely available bioindicator of metal pollution.
