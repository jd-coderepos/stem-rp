Primary and secondary porosity in sandstones possess different pore geometry characteristics, but these are not well quantified. The pore surface area in 2 suites of sandstones exhibiting only primary porosity (Permo-Triassic, Northern Ireland) and only secondary porosity (Cambrian, England) were measured using JMicrovision software. The data show pore surface areas per unit pore volume âˆ¼2.5 times as great in the secondary porosity compared to the primary porosity. This difference is great enough to have a significant impact on properties dependent on pore surface area, including oil production and capacity for microbial colonization in the deep biosphere.
