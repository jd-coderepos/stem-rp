Concentrations and flux densities of methane were determined during a Lagrangian study of an advective filament in the permanent upwelling region off western Mauritania. Newly upwelled waters were dominated by the presence of North Atlantic Central Water and surface CH4 concentrations of 2.2±0.3nmolL−1 were largely in equilibrium with atmospheric values, with surface saturations of 101.7±14%. As the upwelling filament aged and was advected offshore, CH4 enriched South Atlantic Central Water from intermediate depths of 100–350m was entrained into the surface mixed layer of the filament following intense mixing associated with the shelf break. Surface saturations increased to 198.9±15% and flux densities increased from a mean value over the shelf of 2.0±1.1μmolm−2 d−1 to a maximum of 22.6μmolm−2 d−1. Annual CH4 emissions for this persistent filament were estimated at 0.77±0.64Gg which equates to a maximum of 0.35% of the global oceanic budget. This raises the known outgassing intensity of this area and highlights the importance of advecting filaments from upwelling waters as efficient vehicles for air-sea exchange.
