Assigning uncertainty to ocean-color satellite products is a requirement to allow informed use of these data. Here, uncertainty estimates are derived using the comparison on a 12th-degree grid of coincident daily records of the remote-sensing reflectance R RS obtained with the same processing chain from three satellite missions, MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS. The approach is spatially resolved and produces σ, the part of the R RS uncertainty budget associated with random effects. The global average of σ decreases with wavelength from approximately 0.7–0.910−3 sr−1 at 412nm to 0.05–0.110−3 sr−1 at the red band, with uncertainties on σ evaluated as 20–30% between 412 and 555nm, and 30–40% at 670nm. The distribution of σ shows a restricted spatial variability and small variations with season, which makes the multi-annual global distribution of σ an estimate applicable to all retrievals of the considered missions. The comparison of σ with other uncertainty estimates derived from field data or with the support of algorithms provides a consistent picture. When translated in relative terms, and assuming a relatively low bias, the distribution of σ suggests that the objective of a 5% uncertainty is fulfilled between 412 and 490nm for oligotrophic waters (chlorophyll-a concentration below 0.1mgm−3). This study also provides comparison statistics. Spectrally, the mean absolute relative difference between R RS from different missions shows a characteristic U-shape with both ends at blue and red wavelengths inversely related to the amplitude of R RS . On average and for the considered data sets, SeaWiFS R RS tend to be slightly higher than MODIS R RS , which in turn appear higher than MERIS R RS . Biases between mission-specific R RS may exhibit a seasonal dependence, particularly in the subtropical belt.
