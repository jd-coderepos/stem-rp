We used density functional theory (DFT) to examine the partitioning of ferrous iron between periclase and bridgmanite under lower mantle conditions. To study the effects of the three major variables — pressure, temperature and concentration — these have been varied from 0 to 150GPa, from 1000 to 4000K and from 0 to 100% total iron content. We find that increasing temperature increases K D, increasing iron concentration decreases K D, while pressure can both increase and decrease K D. We find that K D decreases slowly from about 0.32 to 0.06 with depth under lower mantle conditions. We also find that K D increases sharply to 0.15 in the very lowermost mantle due to the strong temperature increases near the CMB. Spin transitions have a large effect on the activity of ferropericlase which causes K D to vary with pressure in a peak-like fashion. Despite the apparently large changes in K D through the mantle, this actually results in relatively small changes in total iron content in the two phases, with X Fe fp ranging from about 0.20 to 0.35, before decreasing again to about 0.28 at the CMB, and X Fe bd has a pretty constant value of about 0.04–0.07 throughout the lower mantle. For the very high Fe concentrations suggested for ULVZs, Fe partitions very strongly into ferropericlase.
