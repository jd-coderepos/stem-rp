A spatial and micro-stratigraphic interpretation of the Gravettian open-air site Krems-Wachtberg in Lower Austria uses analysis of the lithic artefacts of an area of the excavations. The results are based on conclusive aspects of the artefact morphology and raw material attribution. Investigations focus on the acquisition of the spatial structure of living floor AH (archaeological horizon) 4.4 with a well-preserved hearth. Different utilization phases of hearth 1 with their relationships to the surrounding areas are discussed and a comparison of the in situ AH 4.4 and the post-occupational deposition of AH 4.11 presented. The examination of the artefact typology supports an attribution to the Early Gravettian of Central Europe (Pavlovian, 30â€“24 ka BP).
