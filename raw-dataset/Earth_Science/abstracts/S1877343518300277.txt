Restoration ecology is gaining momentum on the international conservation scene. In particular, restoring degraded ecosystems is central to Aichi Biodiversity Targets 14 and 15 set by the Convention on Biological Diversity. Depending on the definition of degradation, from 2 to 47% of the global land surface could require restoration. Here, we review the range of goals and approaches to restoration, from active interventions to more passive approaches such as rewilding. We identify biodiversity offsets, payments for ecosystem services and agri-enviromental schemes as enabling policy mechanisms for restoration. Finally, we assess national conservation targets to examine the potential multifaceted impacts of achieving Aichi Targets 14 and 15 on biodiversity and society.
