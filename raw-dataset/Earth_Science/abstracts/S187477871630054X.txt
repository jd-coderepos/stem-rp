Maraena whitefish (Coregonus maraena, Bloch, 1779) is a high-quality food fish belonging to the family Salmonidae with considerable economic relevance in the Baltic area. Aquaculture of this species is fundamental for its successful conservation and thus sustainable fisheries. Robust fishes obtained from breeding lines build the basis for effective aquaculture. Doubtless, the utilization of transcriptome sequencing and identification of genetic markers contribute to this aim. 454 FLX Titanium Sequencing provided 1.31 million sequence reads representing a first insight into the C. maraena transcriptome. The 454 Newbler Assembly arranged 29,094 contigs with an average length of 798bp. We found a whole series of transcripts highly probably resulting from ancient genome duplication and annotated 2887 different transcripts with an average length of 812bp. Functional annotation obtained a transcript composition predominantly comprising enzyme-coding genes.
