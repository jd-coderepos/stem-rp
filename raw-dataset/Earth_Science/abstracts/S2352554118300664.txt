Conventional treatment of crude oil contamination in open water of chemical dispersants, churning, burning, and soaking has limited effect and in-itself is potentially hazardous. We sought to provide an advanced bio-based green and sustainable chemistry solution that is safe and effective. A novel formula (EcoBioClean®) of proprietary microorganisms, enzymes, catalysts and nutritive components was constituted as a non-toxic rapid-impact remediation, reverse-engineering and bioconversion system. The formula transformed a crude oil slick within minutes into punctate particles resembling ground black pepper. A 21-day post treatment analysis using GC-MS confirmed the North Alaskan Slope Crude had become a nutrient-rich broth containing valuable elements such as choline, fatty acids, Carotene, Vitamin C, Iron, Vitamin E, Copper, Magnesium, Manganese, Phosphorus, Potassium, Zinc, Vitamin D and more than 15 amino acids. Upon contact EcoBioClean® initiates the conversion of crude oil into bio-available nutrient-rich marine food. The result is a benefit to marine life, the ecosystem, the environment, and the economy.
