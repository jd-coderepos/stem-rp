We have generated a high-resolution catalog called the “Japan Unified hIgh-resolution relocated Catalog for Earthquakes” (JUICE), which can be used to evaluate the geometry and seismogenic depth of active faults in Japan. We relocated >1.1 million hypocenters from the NIED Hi-net catalog for events which occurred between January 2001 and December 2012, to a depth of 40km. We apply a relative hypocenter determination method to the data in each grid square, in which entire Japan is divided into 1257 grid squares to parallelize the relocation procedure. We used a double-difference method, incorporating cross-correlating differential times as well as catalog differential times. This allows us to resolve, in detail, a seismicity distribution for the entire Japanese Islands. We estimated location uncertainty by a statistical resampling method, using Jackknife samples, and show that the uncertainty can be within 0.37km in the horizontal and 0.85km in the vertical direction with a 90% confidence interval for areas with good station coverage. Our seismogenic depth estimate agrees with the lower limit of the hypocenter distribution for a recent earthquake on the Kamishiro fault (2014, Mj 6.7), which suggests that the new catalog should be useful for estimating the size of future earthquakes for inland active faults.
