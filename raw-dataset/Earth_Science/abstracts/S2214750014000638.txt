Diabetic complications cause noticeable liver damage, which finally progresses to diabetic hepatopathy. Nutritive antioxidants not only reduce the liver damage, but also prevent it by modulating the release of various proteins involved in apoptotic signaling cascades. This study explores the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetes-induced liver damage and its modulation by naringenin. Antioxidant status, liver & kidney biomarker enzymes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial membrane potential, expression of apoptotic proteins like Bax (bcl-2 associated X), Bcl-2 (b-cell Lymhoma-2), Caspase-3, Caspase-9, AIF (Apoptosis inducing factor) and Endo-G (Endonuclease-G) were studied in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. Significant hyperglycemia, disturbed antioxidant status, altered carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes, increased ROS and lipid peroxidation; decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced release of AIF and Endo-G were observed. Hyperglycemia also affected apoptosis and its related genes at both transcriptional and translational level (Caspase-3 & 9, Bax and Bcl-2) in the liver of diabetic rats. Naringenin, a flavonone, exerted anti-hyperglycemic effect and was able to prevent oxidative stress and resultant apoptotic events caused due to diabetes-induced hepatotoxicity. Thus, our study shows, a protective effect of naringenin against diabetes induced liver damage and redox imbalance, which could further be exploited for the management of diabetic hepatopathy.
