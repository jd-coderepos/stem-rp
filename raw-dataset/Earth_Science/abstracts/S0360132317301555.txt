Generating economical, high-resolution and high-quality computational grids for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of wind flow and convective heat transfer (CHT) around surface-mounted obstacles is not straightforward. When the grid size is used as filter, LES grids should ideally consist of cubic cells, while CHT requires a very high near-wall resolution to resolve the thin viscous sublayer and buffer layer that represent the largest resistance to CHT. To avoid very high cell numbers and the need for excessive computational resources, non-conformal grids can be considered. This paper provides a detailed evaluation of the performance of non-conformal grids with cubic cells, for wind flow and CHT around a wall-mounted cubic obstacle. LES results on non-conformal versus conformal grids are compared with each other and with wind-tunnel measurements of wind speed and surface temperature. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is performed concerning the impact of overall grid resolution, subdomain size and grid refinement ratio. Average absolute deviations between LES on non-conformal versus conformal grids are about 0.9% (0.5 °C) for surface temperature on all cube surfaces. Comparison with experiments shows for the non-conformal grid an average and maximum absolute deviation for surface temperature of 2.0% (1.1 °C) and 7.6% (3.6 °C), respectively. The sensitivity analysis shows minor impact of subdomain size on convective heat transfer coefficients (CHTC) where, on average, absolute deviations of less than 2.2% are observed. This study shows that non-conformal grids can strongly reduce the total cell count (here by a factor up to 30.2) without significantly compromising the accuracy of results.
