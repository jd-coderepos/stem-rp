The extensive use of antibiotics leading to the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance poses high health risks to humans, but to date there is still lack of a quantitative model to properly assess the risks. Concerns over the health risk of antibiotic residues in the environment are mainly (1) the potential hazard of ingested antibiotic residues in the environment altering the human microbiome and promoting emergence and selection for bacteria resistance inhabiting the human body, and (2) the potential hazard of creating a selection pressure on environmental microbiome and leading to reservoirs of antibiotic resistance in the environment. We provide a holistic view of health risk assessment of antibiotic resistance associated with antibiotic residues in the environment in contrast with that of the antibiotic resistant bacteria and discuss the main knowledge gaps and the future research that should be prioritized to achieve the quantitative risk assessment. We examined and summarized the available data and information on the four core elements of antibiotic resistance associated with antibiotic residues in the environment: hazard identification, exposure assessment, dose-response assessment, and risk characterization. The data required to characterize the risks of antibiotic residues in the environment is severely limited. The main future research needs have been identified to enable better assessments of antibiotic resistance associated with antibiotic residues in the environment: (1) establishment of a standardized monitoring guide of antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistance in the environment, (2) derivation of the relationship between antibiotic levels and pathogenic antibiotic-resistance development in different settings, and (3) establishment of the dose-response relationship between pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria and various infection diseases. After identification of key risk determinant parameters, we propose a conceptual framework of human health risk assessments of antibiotic residues in the environment. Capsule A holistic view of human health risk assessment of antibiotic residues in the environment was provided.
