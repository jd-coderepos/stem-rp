Three methods are described in order to solve the canonical problem of the one-dimensional reflection by a semi-infinite periodic row of identical scatterers. The exact reflection coefficient R is determined. The first method is associated with shifting the domain by a single period and subsequently considering two scatterers, one being a single scatterer and the second being the entire semi-infinite array. The second method determines the reflection coefficient R N associated with a finite array of N scatterers. The limit as N → ∞ is then taken. In general R N does not converge to R in this limit, although we summarize various arguments that can be made to ensure the correct limit is achieved. The third method considers direct approaches. In particular, for point masses, the governing inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation is solved using the discrete Wiener–Hopf technique.
