This work provides new insight into the degradation of 2,2-dimethyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-7-yl-methylcarbamate (hereafter carbofuran) by natural pyrite as a function of pH and adsorbent loading. In the presence of tert-butyl alcohol i.e., OH scavenger, the degradation efficiency of carbofuran was almost stopped. In acidic solutions (pH<5) the degradation kinetics was pseudo first order in carbofuran as − d [ carbofuran ] d t = − k observed × [ carbofuran ] . The dependence of k observed on [FeS2] was given as k observed = k 0 +[FeS2]× k 1 where k0 =1.16×10−7 h−1 and k 1 =0.137h−1. The elucidation of precise steps of carbofuran degradation by pyrite has yet to be solved.
