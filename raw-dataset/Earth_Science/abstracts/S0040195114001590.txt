The eastern Karakoram terrane, NW India, records crustal evolution in the core of the Himalayan–Tibetan orogen. Recent debate has centred on whether prograde metamorphism, anatexis and leucogranite emplacement were the result of localised shear heating and magma advection within the Karakoram Fault Zone (KFZ) or instead predate the KFZ and were the result of regional tectonometamophic events. Inclusions within andalusite porphyroblasts that grew during 15.7Ma leucogranite emplacement have fabrics that are random or discordant to the KFZ matrix foliation, indicating that the KFZ initiated after this time. Therefore, earlier anatexis and metamorphism are the result of regional metamorphic events. Amphibole–plagioclase thermobarometry on a c. 17Ma migmatite melanosome, later exhumed within a transpressional zone of the KFZ, shows that melting occurred at 688°C and 522MPa. Amphibolites record an older kyanite-grade metamorphic event that occurred at 677–736°C and 875–1059MPa. Metapelites also record a kyanite-grade event which is constrained by Ti-in-biotite thermometry to have occurred at 622°C and >650MPa. The tectonometamorphic history of the eastern Karakoram correlates closely with that of the central Karakoram away from the KFZ. This correlation supports the interpretation that metamorphism and anatexis were regional in extent and also indicates a limited offset of <150km on the KFZ.
