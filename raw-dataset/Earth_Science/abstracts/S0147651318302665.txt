The efficiency of lactic acid fermentation (LAF) as a pretreatment for human feces was investigated in laboratory-scale experiments that lasted for 3 weeks. The sanitization effect of LAF on fecal sludge (FS) was conducted in triplicate. This study used three materials, namely, lactobacillus of lactic acid bacteria, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour, which were known to enhance the production of lactic acid. Each material was mixed in three different reactors at equal ratio with raw FS (i.e., 1:1 v/w, w/w, and w/w). The pH decline rate, lactic acid production rate, and fecal coliform suppression degree were monitored over the period of the treatment process as parameters to evaluate the efficiency of various LAF for pathogen inactivation in FS. Results showed that only fermented rice flour was able to completely inactivate the indicator organism (fecal coliform) at the end of fermentation. Final plate counts of 8.6 × 108 CFU/100 mL, 2.4 × 108 CFU/100 mL, and zero (0) were achieved from lactobacillus, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour treatment processes, respectively. The final pH from the reactors that contained lactobacillus and FS, cassava flour and FS, and fermented rice flour and FS were 5.5, 8, and 3.9, respectively. This study revealed that not all LAF materials can effectively suppress pathogens in FS. The results serve as the foundation in developing an effective, cheap, and easy to use LAF on FS pretreatment for pathogen inactivation.
