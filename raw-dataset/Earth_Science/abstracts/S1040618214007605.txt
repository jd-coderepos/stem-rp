During the penultimate glaciation vast areas of the Alps were glaciated, with piedmont glaciers protruding into the foreland. In the easternmost part of the northward draining valleys of the Alps, the glaciers did not reach the foreland, but formed valley glaciers confined by the mountainous terrain. This also applies to the Ybbs valley, where samples for luminescence dating out of glaciofluvial gravel accumulations were taken at three locations along the present day river course. In a highly dynamic depositional environment, such as a glacier-fed river system, incomplete resetting of the luminescence signal is possible, in particular when transport distances are short. In such cases, quartz usually is the preferred mineral over feldspar, especially if dose rates are low and may theoretically allow obtaining quartz ages beyond 150 ka. Because previous research has shown, and as corroborated within this study, quartz from the research area exhibits analytical problems in the high age range. Therefore luminescence properties of coarse grain (100–200 μm) quartz and in addition K-rich feldspar were investigated with the aim to reconstruct the chronology of the glacial processes within the Ybbs catchment area. Issues of incomplete bleaching were pIRIR225 encountered and addressed by comparing quartz OSL, fading corrected K feldspar IR50 and pIRIR225 to identify reliable ages. Depositional ages based on quartz OSL and feldspar pIRIR225 signals revealed deposition of ice marginal kame terraces and glaciofluvial foreland terraces during late to middle MIS 6. In combination with results from previous studies, we could reconstruct the valley evolution during the Riss glaciation. Newly gained luminescence ages of the deglaciation in the easternmost Alps coincide with OSL dated deglaciation events in the Western Alps, indicating that climatic change along the north side of the Alps happened simultaneously.
