Co-firing of biomass and coal and biomass reduces the emission of pollutants and the overall effects have been extensively studied, but many aspects of the detailed mechanism remain uncertain. A number of studies have been previously made by us of emissions from the combustion in a fixed-bed furnace of bituminous coal and wood, both individually and together, and it was observed that biomass produced less soot and lower NOX emissions. These data are combined with recent measurements of emissions of black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC), which are an important source of climate forcing, from the combustion of a number of solid fuels. Conclusion are drawn about the nature of the OC and how the values are dependent on the measurement technique used. Complementary analytical-scale combustion and pyrolysis experiments were also carried out. The results of the analysis of emissions and reaction products, mainly by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), were interpreted so as to construct a model for pollutant formation during co-firing. There is a reduction of smoke from the combustion of torrefied biomass and this is considered in relation to the torrefaction processes.
