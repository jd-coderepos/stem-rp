The temporal transition from backarc extension to retroarc shortening is a fundamental process in the evolution of many Andean-type convergent margins. This switch in tectonic regime is preserved in the 5–7 km thick Mesozoic-Cenozoic stratigraphic record of west-central Argentina at 34–36°S, where the northern Neuquén Basin and succeeding Cenozoic foreland succession chronicle a long history of fluctuating depositional systems and diverse sediment source regions during Andean orogenesis. New findings from sediment provenance and facies analyses are integrated with detrital zircon U-Pb geochronological results from 16 samples of Jurassic through Miocene clastic deposits to delineate the progressive exhumation of the evolving Andean magmatic arc, retroarc fold-thrust belt, and foreland province. Abrupt changes in provenance and depositional conditions can be reconciled with a complex Mesozoic-Cenozoic history of extension, postextensional thermal subsidence, punctuated tectonic inversion, thick- and thin-skinned shortening, overlapping igneous activity, and alternating phases of basin accumulation, sediment bypass, and erosion. U-Pb age distributions constrain the depositional ages of Cenozoic units and reveal a prolonged late middle Eocene to earliest Miocene (roughly 40–20 Ma) hiatus in the retroarc foreland basin. This stratigraphic gap is expressed as a regional disconformity that marks a pronounced shift in depositional conditions and sediment sources, from (i) slow Paleocene–middle Eocene accumulation of distal fluviolacustrine sediments (Pircala and Coihueco Formations) contributed from far western magmatic arc sources (Cretaceous–Paleogene volcanic rocks) and subordinate eastern basement rocks (Permian-Triassic Choiyoi igneous complex) to (ii) rapid Miocene–Quaternary accumulation of proximal fluvial to megafan sediments (Agua de la Piedra, Loma Fiera, and Tristeza Formations) recycled from emerging western thrust-belt sources of Mesozoic basin fill originally derived from basement and magmatic arc sources. The mid-Cenozoic stratigraphic gap signified ∼20 Myr of nondeposition, potentially during passage of a flexural forebulge or during neutral to extensional conditions driven by mechanical decoupling and a possible retreating-slab configuration along the Nazca-South America plate boundary. Neogene eastward propagation of the Malargüe fold-thrust belt involved basement inversion with geometrically and kinematically linked thin-skinned shortening at shallow foreland levels, including late Miocene deposition of accurately dated 10.5–7.5 Ma growth strata and ensuing displacement along the frontal emergent and blind thrust structures. Subsequent partitioning and exhumation of Cenozoic clastic fill of the Malargüe foreland basin has been driven by inboard advance of arc magmatism and Pliocene-Quaternary uplift of the San Rafael basement block farther east.
