Chemical pollution of the marine environment from anthropogenic sources is a global concern due to the potential for long term effects on the ecosystem. Chemical monitoring schemes can detect harmful substances in water, sediment or biota. However, the presence of specific determinants gives no information on how individual species or the ecosystem are impacted. Biological effects techniques are therefore used in environmental monitoring schemes to provide a clearer picture of whether the chemicals present are causing deleterious effects on the species sampled, or whether organisms have been exposed to certain classes of organic contaminants that they may be able to metabolise. Using these techniques, we can provide an assessment of the health of our marine environment (Thain et al., 2008).
