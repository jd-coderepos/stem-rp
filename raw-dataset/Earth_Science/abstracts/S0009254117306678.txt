Tungsten is a moderately siderophile element and, thus, enriched in the Earth's core. Moreover, W behaves incompatibly during partial melting, causing relative enrichment in the Earth's crust compared to the mantle. However, little is known about the geochemical cycle of the redox-sensitive element W in the crust-mantle system and in modern to ancient low-temperature environments. High resolution stable W isotope measurements of rock samples from different geochemical reservoirs might be a powerful tool to better constrain this cycle. So far, low relative mass differences between the different W isotopes and analytical challenges hampered such high-resolution measurements. Notably, some pioneering studies on the stable W isotope composition of geological reference material show inconsistent results, calling for further verification of the true compositions of these materials. This study presents an analytical protocol for stable W isotope measurements including the calibration of a 180W-183W double-spike as well as W isotope and W concentration data of several geological reference materials (BHVO-2, AGV-2, SDC-1, W-2a, ScO-2, NOD-A-1, NOD-P-1). The reproducibility of stable W isotope measurements (±0.018‰ in δ186/184W; 2s.d.) is significantly improved compared to previous studies, which allows resolving between the stable W isotope compositions of various rock reservoirs on Earth. Relative to the NIST SRM 3163 standard, the highest δ186/184W value was observed for the Pacific Mn crust NOD-P-1 (+0.154±0.013‰; 2s.d.; n =6), which is significantly different from the δ186/184W value of the Atlantic Mn crust NOD-A-1 (+0.029±0.014‰; 2s.d.; n =6). Considering equilibrium fractionation between seawater WO4 2− and slowly growing Mn oxides, this indicates an isotopically heterogeneous distribution of W in the modern oceans. Igneous rocks also show a resolvable range in δ186/184W values. Magmatic reference materials range in δ186/184W between +0.016±0.032‰ (andesite AGV-2; 2s.d.; n =5) and +0.082±0.010‰ (basalt BHVO-2; 2s.d.; n=5) showing relative enrichment of light isotopes in more evolved magmatic rocks. These isotopic differences might result from isotope fractionation during magmatic differentiation. Alternatively, the mobilization of W by hydrothermal and/or magmatic fluids might be accompanied by isotope fractionation.
