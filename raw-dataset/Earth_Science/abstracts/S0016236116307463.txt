This paper investigates whether or not two persistent diesel dogmas, namely “the higher the cetane number (CN) the better” and “the lower the aromaticity the better”, still ring true when a compression ignition engine is operated in the low temperature combustion (LTC) regime. The transition from conventional, high temperature combustion (HTC) to LTC is realized in a step-wise approach by increasing the level of exhaust gas recirculation, reducing the compression ratio and by lowering intake pressure. The fuel matrix spans a range of both aromaticity and CN. All experiments are conducted on a modified DAF heavy-duty compression ignition engine. Two main conclusions can be drawn from the results. First, at equal aromaticity, there is no discernible benefit of a high CN with respect to the soot-NOx trade-off in the HTC mode. In fact, when operating in the LTC regime, a high CN even results in a penalty in aforementioned trade-off. Second, at equal CN, increased aromatic content always has a negative impact on the soot-NOx trade-off, irrespective of combustion mode. Accordingly, our results demonstrate that, with respect to the soot-NOx trade-off, the first and second dogma is valid in neither and both of the combustion modes, respectively.
