Metabolomics analysis of body fluids as well as cells is depended on many factors. While several well-accepted standard operating procedures for the analysis of body fluids are available, the NMR based quantitative analysis of cellular metabolites is less well standardized. Experimental designs depend on the cell type, the quenching protocol and the applied post-acquisition workflow. Here, we provide a tutorial for the quantitative description of the metabolic phenotype of mammalian cells using NMR spectroscopy. We discuss all key steps of the process, starting from the selection of the appropriate culture medium, quenching techniques to arrest metabolism in a reproducible manner, the extraction of the intracellular components and the profiling of the culture medium. NMR data acquisition and methods for both qualitative and quantitative analysis are also provided. The suggested methods cover experiments for adherent cells and cells in suspension. We ultimately describe the application of the discussed workflow to a thyroid cancer cell line. Although this tutorial focuses on mammalian cells, the given guidelines and procedures may be adjusted for the analysis of other cell types.
