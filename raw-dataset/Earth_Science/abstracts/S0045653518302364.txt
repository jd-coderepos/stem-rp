A novel arrangement for an electro-Fenton reactor aimed to treat neutral wastewater is presented. The arrangement consists on three-compartments in series, two of them packed with a cation exchange resin and one positioned between these, containing a polarized activated carbon column where the electrochemical generation of the Fenton reagent takes place. While the hydroxyl radicals electrochemically produced in-situ, react with the pollutant species adsorbed on the activated carbon cathode, the resin compartments administrate and collect the iron cation and the hydrated proton species in alternating flow direction cycles. The resulting process is a system that does not require acid or iron chemical addition to the process while at the same time, renders decontaminated water free of iron-dissolved species at neutral pH. The proposed electrochemical reactor arrangement is therefore the basis for the design of commercially viable electro-Fenton reactors in which the addition and subsequent removal of acid and iron chemicals is avoided; two of the currently most limiting features for the development of electro-Fenton technology for treating wastewater.
