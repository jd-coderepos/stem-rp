Exposure to high levels of road traffic noise at the most exposed building facade is increasing, both due to urbanization and due to overall traffic increase. This study investigated how different noise reduction measures would influence the noise exposure on a city-wide scale in Gothenburg, a city in Sweden with approximately 550,000 inhabitants. Noise exposure was estimated under several different scenarios for the period 2015â€“2035, using the standardized Nordic noise prediction method together with traffic flow measurements and population statistics. The scenarios were based on reducing speed limits, reducing traffic flows, introducing more electrically powered vehicles and introducing low-noise tires and pavements. The most effective measures were introducing low-noise tires or pavements, which in comparison to business as usual produced between 13% and 29% reduction in the number of inhabitants exposed above 55 dB equivalent level.
