Uncertainty in operational hydrological forecast systems forced with numerical weather predictions is often assessed by quantifying the uncertainty from the inputs only. However, part of the uncertainty in modelled discharge stems from the hydrological model. A multi-model system can account for some of this uncertainty, but there exists a plethora of hydrological models and it is not trivial to select those that fit specific needs and collectively capture a representative spread of model uncertainty. This paper provides a technical review of 24 large-scale models to provide guidance for model selection. Suitability for the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), as example of an operational continental flood forecasting system, is discussed based on process descriptions, flexibility in resolution, input data requirements, availability of code and more. The model choice is in the end subjective, but this review intends to objectively assist in selecting the most appropriate model for the intended purpose.
