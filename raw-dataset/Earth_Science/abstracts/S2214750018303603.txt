Noble metal nanoparticles afford a tool for investigation and its application in biological systems has had the greatest impact in biology and biomedicine. The present work reports an ecofriendly approach for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using an aqueous leaf extract of Getonia floribunda. The silver nanoparticles were characterized by using following instruments viz. UV–vis spectrophotometer, FTIR, XRD AFM and HR-TEM. The UV–vis spectrum showed a characteristic absorption peak at 404 nm. FTIR data reveals the possible involvement of various functional groups for reduction and biocapping of AgNPs. XRD data confirmed the crystalline nature of silver nanoparticles. Morphology, size and distribution of the AgNPs were determined by using AFM and HR-TEM. The average size of AgNPs ranges between 10 and 25 nm and are spherical in shape. The silver nanoparticles were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect on mitotic chromosomes of root meristematic cells of D. polyantha using different concentrations viz. 4, 8, 12 and 16 μg/ml at the time interval of 6, 12, 18 and 24 h. It is evident from the results that the higher concentration of AgNPs found to inhibit mitotic index and caused chromosomal abnormalities such as chromosomal bridge, sticky chromosomes, laggard anaphase, diagonal anaphase, c-metaphase and chromosomal breaks. Therefore, it can be concluded that higher concentrations of silver nanoparticles may induce significant inhibition of root meristem activity and causing DNA damage.
