Study region The Upper Adige catchment, South Tyrol, Italy. Study focus The empirical snow density models of Jonas et al. (2009) and Sturm et al. (2010), are compared with a simple equation that predicts snow density based on the day of the year only. New hydrological insights The simple equation presents similar uncertainty compared to the more complex empirical models. It appears robust for regions with snow of Alpine and Maritime characteristics, and can be easily recalibrated as more data become available. The proposed model estimates snowpack density as an initial value of 200kg/m3 at the beginning of the snow cover season (November 1st), to be increased by 1kg/m3 for each elapsed day. The model residuals standard deviation is about 13%, which is comparable to the within-site spatial variability.
