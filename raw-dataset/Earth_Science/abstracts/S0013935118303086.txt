The Horizon 2020 prize for the “Engine Retrofit for Clean Air” aims at reducing the pollution in cities by spurring the development of retrofit technology for diesel engines. A Euro 5 passenger car was retrofitted with an under-floor SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) for NOx catalyst in combination with a solid ammonia based dosing system as the NOx reductant. The vehicle was tested both on the road and on the chassis dynamometer under various test cycles and ambient temperatures. The NOx emissions were reduced by 350–1100 mg/km (60–85%) in the laboratory depending on the test cycle and engine conditions (cold or hot start), except at type approval conditions. The reduction for cold start urban cycles was < 75 mg/km (< 15%). The on road and laboratory tests were inline. In some high speed conditions significant increase of ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured. No effect was seen on other pollutants (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particles). The results of the present study show that retrofitting high emitting vehicles can significantly reduce vehicle NOx emissions and ultimately pollution in cities.
