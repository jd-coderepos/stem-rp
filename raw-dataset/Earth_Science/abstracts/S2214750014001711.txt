Curcumin (CUR) is a highly pleiotropic molecule and possesses anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, antioxidative, wound-healing and antimicrobial activities. The present study was carried out to investigate whether CUR plays any beneficial role in streptozotocin (STZ) induced hepatic pathophysiology in diabetic rats. STZ exposure increased hepatic damage associated serum markers (ALT, ALP and LDH) as well as NO production in the liver tissue. Moreover, the same exposure enhanced ROS generation and lipid peroxidation; reduced GSH levels and antioxidant enzyme activities. Hyperglycemia induced hepatic pathophysiology also activated stress response pathways (involving phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2 MAPKs and p53) and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential which in turn led to cellular apoptosis as evidenced from increased hepatic DNA fragmentation as well as FACS analysis. However, treatment with CUR effectively counteracts diabetes-induced, oxidative stress mediated hepatic damage and could act as a therapeutic in lessening liver dysfunction in diabetic subjects.
