This study was aimed at establishing a water quality database in the study area where none existed previously. Samples were taken from two different sites of River Oluwa, South-Western Nigeria. Physicochemical and biological factors and the metals for one year (April 2011â€“March 2012) were evaluated using standard methods. All the physical parameters of the water samples from the two sampling Sites did not show deviations from Nigeria Industrial Standard (NIS) for permissible levels of these parameters in drinking water. Virtually all heavy metals investigated deviated from the permissible levels allowed by NIS, and WHO standards in drinking water. In the same vein, all chemical parameters investigated during the dry season was significantly different from rainy season except for BOD at P < 0.05. Isolated microorganisms include members of the genera Bacillus, Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Proteus and Staphylococcus. The public health implications of consuming water from this river are fully discussed.
