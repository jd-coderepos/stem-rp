Analyses of spatial interaction are to some degree plagued by uncertainty regarding the impact of spatially dispersed interaction masses within zones on travel times. In this paper, interaction-weighted travel times are computed from a matrix between regularly distributed points at fine resolution, and used together with secondary data to improve estimates of interaction weighted travel time based on commonly applied methods. The paper proposes a method for computing intra-zonal, interaction weighted travel times that is considerably less sensitive to spatial aggregation than existing approaches, and demonstrates that population-weighted centroids are to be preferred over geographically-weighted centroids.
