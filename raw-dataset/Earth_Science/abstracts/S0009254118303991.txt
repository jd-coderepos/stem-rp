Pyrochlore from the Kaiserstuhl volcanic complex (SW Germany) shows textural and compositional differences between various coarse-grained calcite-carbonatite bodies (Badberg, Degenmatt, Haselschacher Buck, Orberg) and extrusive carbonatites (Henkenberg, Kirchberg). Oscillatory-zoned F-rich pyrochlore with up to 69 wt% Nb2O5 is common in all coarse-grained calcite-carbonatite bodies and probably formed during magmatic conditions. However, only in some of the samples from the Badberg, partly resorbed U- and Ta-enriched pyrochlore cores with up to 22 wt% UO2 and 9 wt% Ta2O5 have been identified, which are interpreted as being inherited from underlying nosean syenites. Pyrochlore data from a drill core penetrating the Badberg indicate increasing contents of REE, U, and Ta with depth, while Nb, F and Na contents decrease. This may reflect the combined effects of fractional crystallization and assimilation (AFC) or indicates a multi-stage emplacement of the carbonatitic magma. Patchy-zoned ceriopyrochlore and REE- and Th-enriched pyrochlore with up to 19 wt% total REE2O3 and 6.5 wt% ThO2 is largely restricted to samples from the Orberg and probably formed during hydrothermal conditions. This can be related to the relatively evolved character of the Orberg carbonatites, based on their relatively high whole-rock Nb/Ta and Zr/Hf mass ratios. This study demonstrates that the textural and compositional variation of pyrochlore in carbonatites is a powerful tool to distinguish magmatic, hydrothermal and weathering processes in carbonatitic systems.
