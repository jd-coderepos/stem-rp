Landfill disposal has thus far been the predominant treatment method for municipal solid waste (MSW) throughout Brazil, including São Paulo city. Environmentally sustainable development of MSW management in São Paulo necessitates a stepwise reduction of landfilling. However, ever increasing MSW generation poses the challenge of managing increasing MSW volumes while simultaneously modernizing the MSW management system. In this study, the environmental impacts of the current MSW management system and future alternatives in the city were assessed by means of life cycle assessment (LCA) to determine a pathway towards more environmentally sustainable MSW management. The assessed impact categories were global warming, acidification and eutrophication potentials. Potential future alternatives included the stepwise reduction of landfilling by the introduction of composting, anaerobic digestion and mechanical-biological treatment (MBT). The results of the study indicated that the environmental impacts of MSW management in São Paulo can be most effectively diminished by anaerobic digestion of source separated organic waste and MBT of MSW, on condition that the produced refuse-derived fuel (RDF) is utilized in cement production as a substitute for coal. The other utilization option for RDF, incineration, would increase the environmental impacts of MSW management due to the low amount of avoided emissions resulting from electricity substitution since average electricity production in Brazil is dominated by hydropower. Sensitivity analyses indicated, however, that the environmental impacts of incineration might decrease with different modeling assumptions, e.g. the modeling assumption regarding the kind of electricity production substituted by electricity production from MSW. Nevertheless, the main findings of the study remained the same and they are in line with the previous literature.
