Freshwater aquatic organisms face the challenge of being exposed to a multitude of chemicals discharged by the human population. The objective of this study was to rank metals according to the threat they pose to aquatic organisms. This will contribute to a wider Chemical Strategy for freshwater which will risk-rank all chemicals based on their potential risk to wildlife in a UK setting. The method involved comparing information on ecotoxicological thresholds with measured concentrations in rivers. The bioconcentration factor was also considered as a ranking method. The metals; Ag, Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn, were analysed using this approach. Triclosan and lindane were used as comparative organic pollutants. Using a range of ranking techniques, Cu, Al and Zn came top of the list of concern, with Cu coming first.
