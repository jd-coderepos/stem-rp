In this study we look at everyday politics of electric bike mobility by exploring the social practices of e-bike users in order to understand the role of e-bikes in emerging low-carbon mobility system in China, asking ‘where is the politics of the E2W in contemporary China?’ We explore the underlying political tensions in electric two-wheeler mobility by examining family and informal e-bike journeys. We argue that ‘civilizational’ government perspective provides a new way of thinking about politics of mobility and system transition in China.
