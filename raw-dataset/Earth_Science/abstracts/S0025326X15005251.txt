Dredging, river plumes and natural resuspension events can release sediments into the water column where they exert a range of effects on underlying communities. In this review we examine possible causeâ€“effect pathways whereby light reduction, elevated suspended sediments and sediment deposition could affect the reproductive cycle and early life histories of corals. The majority of reported or likely effects (30+) were negative, including a suite of previously unrecognized effects on gametes. The length of each phase of the life-cycle was also examined together with analysis of water quality conditions that can occur during a dredging project over equivalent durations, providing a range of environmentally relevant exposure scenarios for future testing. The review emphasizes the need to: (a) accurately quantify exposure conditions, (b) identify the mechanism of any effects in future studies, and (c) recognize the close interlinking of proximate factors which could confound interpretation of studies.
