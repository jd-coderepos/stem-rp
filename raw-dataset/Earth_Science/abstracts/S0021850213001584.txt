Urban air quality is severely affected by traffic related particulate matter, including direct emissions from exhaust, brake pad, tire wear and road dust resuspended by vehicular motions. Deposited road dust can also be resuspended by wind force or other anthropogenic activities, and overall it may contribute up to 30% to urban PM10. A mobile resuspended road dust PM10 sampler was developed and constructed which simulates the effects of traffic or gusting winds on road surfaces and collects resuspended PM1−10 samples in a cyclone separator and PM1 samples on filters. The sampler was tested by collecting resuspended road dust at kerbside locations in Veszprém, Hungary. The collected PM1 and PM1−10 fractions were analysed by various analytical methods to show the potential of size-selective on-line sample collection combined with the chemical characterization of resuspended road dust. The main constituents of the resuspended road dust were crustal elements, and it was also possible to determine the mineral phase composition of PM1−10 dust which is generally not feasible from samples collected on filter substrate. The application of the sampling and analysis methods may facilitate the evaluation of resuspended road dust sources in cities as well as help constrain a better source apportionment of urban PM10.
