This paper presents a collaborative framework of an interactive web-GIS platform integrated with a multi-criteria evaluation tool. The platform aims to support the engagement of different stakeholders and the encouragement of a collaborative, decision-making process for flood and landslide management. The conceptual framework is based on initial data collected from field visits and stakeholder meetings carried out in the case study areas of the CHANGES 3 3 CHANGES project is a Marie Curie ITN funded by the European Community's 7th Framework Program. project: the Małopolska Voivodeship of Poland, Buzău County of Romania and the Friuli-Venezia-Giulia region of Italy. Based on the needs and issues identified in each case study, this paper also presents how such a platform could potentially assist and enhance the interactions between risk management stakeholders in formulating and selecting risk management measures. The developed prototype was presented to the local and regional stakeholders of the study areas and feedback was collected to understand the stakeholders’ perspectives in determining whether the platform is useful and applicable for their activities in risk management. Feedback from stakeholder responses indicate that stakeholders found the prototype not only useful, but innovative and supportive in potentially assisting their activities. However, feedback also highlighted several aspects of the platform that can be improved for the development of a full-scale system to apply in practice. This includes the engagement of stakeholders toward higher levels of participation and a more extensive evaluation of the platform by carrying out concrete group exercises in the study areas.
