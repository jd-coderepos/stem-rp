Most deterministic neutron transport codes implement the multi-group approximation theory to solve the linear Boltzmann equation by which the neutron flux and the interaction cross-sections are averaged over discretized energy groups. In order to further reduce the computational cost for large scale and/or time dependent problems, this multi-group information undergoes additional energy group condensation into the so-called few energy group structure which may be used in a broad range of diffusion based full-core analyses. The accuracy and efficiency of few-group based computations is dependent on the number and the boundaries of the discrete energy group structure. Since the flux spectrum used in the homogenization process may not be known a priori and indeed may evolve in space, with burnup, and during transients, the optimal energy group structure depends on reactor type, design, operating conditions, fuel type, and composition. The Canadian Pressure Tube Super-Critical Water-cooled Reactor (PT-SCWR) is a Generation IV advanced reactor system that uses light water above its thermodynamic critical point as coolant and a plutonium-driven thorium fuel mixture. Considering that the anticipated flux spectrum for such a design deviates significantly from the thermal-neutron dominated CANDU designs, there may be a need for improvements in the number and boundaries of the few-group nuclear data. This paper presents a systematic methodology for the delineation of few-group energy structure for the Canadian PT-SCWR. The methodology used the SCALE (Standardized Computer Analysis for Licensing Evaluation) code package to examine the effect of energy group homogenization and determine the structure which minimizes the sensitivity of the results to energy group partitioning. As such, it utilizes normal and off-normal operating conditions to determine the effect of energy homogenization and determines the minimal group of energy boundaries which can accurately capture the lattice physics phenomena within the lattice cell over a wide range of operating and accident conditions.
