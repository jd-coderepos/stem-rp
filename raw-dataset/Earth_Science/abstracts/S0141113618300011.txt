Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) distribute a steep gradient of environmental stress between intertidal and subtidal habits and provide insight into population-scale patterns and underlying processes of variation in physiological tolerance. In this study, 1-year-old-F1 oysters, collected from subtidal and intertidal habitats, were obtained after common garden experiment. Genetic differentiation and physiological responses under air exposure were examined to determine whether they had evolved into local adapted subpopulations. Mortality rate, anaerobic glycolysis metabolism, and energy status indicated that oyster had initiated metabolism depression and anaerobic glycolysis metabolism in both intertidal and subtidal oysters under air exposure. However, the subtidal oysters displayed the larger energy metabolism depressions and the earlier anaerobic glycolysis responses. This may indicate that subtidal oysters were more sensitives to hypoxia stress, which may lead the higher mortality rate under long term of air exposure. Based on a common garden experimental design, we propose that this diversification may have a genetic background. Overall, the clear differences between intertidal and subtidal oysters under air exposure have provided an important reference for their aquaculture and transportation used in commercial production.
