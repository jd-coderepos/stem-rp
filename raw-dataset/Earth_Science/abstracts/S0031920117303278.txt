We revise the high pressure, high temperature phase diagram of CaCO3 using Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with laser heated diamond anvil cell experiments. We confirm numerous aspects of earlier studies, including a recent X-ray diffraction study about the stability field of CaCO3-VII. Our Raman results show that CaCO3-VII is stable in the lower mantle at a depth of 690–1010 km. Our DFT calculations show that the phase transition from aragonite to CaCO3-VII at ≈ 25 GPa and from CaCO3-VII to post-aragonite at ≈ 40 GPa are accompanied by density changes of 2% and 3.5%, respectively. Shear sound velocities change by 9% and −12% across the transitions, respectively. Hence, a sufficient amount, at least locally, of CaCO3 in the Earth’s mantle can be detectable by an increase of the shear velocity at 690 km and a decrease of the shear velocity at 1010 km depths.
