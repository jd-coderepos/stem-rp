X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy is a rapid method used to determine the composition of biomass ash, but the accuracy of the method is sensitive to various factors including ash preparation methods. In this study different types of biomass ash were examined by using wet chemical analysis (WCA) and compared with the respective XRF results. The biomass ash was initially prepared in accordance with the European Standard method at 550째C. At this low combustion temperature the amount of residual unburned carbon is significant. To eliminate this, the ashes were heated at higher temperatures: a batch of twenty biomass ashes were heated at 850째C and a batch of five heated to 815째C. At these higher temperatures there may be loss of inorganic components by vaporisation. Variation in these effects may lead to unreliable results. The relationship between XRF and WCA results are given by regression equations. The ashes processed at 815째C show better agreement between the two analysis methods.
