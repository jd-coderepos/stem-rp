Improving the circularity of our economy calls for easily quantifiable metrics that allow us to track our progress towards circularity. We propose the use of a material quality indicator based on the energy use of recycled products versus their counterparts produced from primary material inputs only. We argue that such an indicator can cover at least the environmental dimension of the circular economy in a sufficient way and is therefore useful for the assessment of the circularity of our economy.
