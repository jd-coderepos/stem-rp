Lead poisoning is considered a public health threat, particularly in developing countries. Health problems from Pb exposure occur in many parts of the world, especially near Pb mines, Pb smelters, and used leadâ€“acid battery (ULAB) recycling plants. In this study, we analyzed the urine metabolome of residents in a village located near a ULAB recycling facility to investigate the biological effects of Pb exposure (ULAB: n = 44, Reference: n = 51). Lasso linear regression models were moderately predictive of blood Pb levels, as evaluated by a training set (R2 = 0.813) and against an external test set (R2 EXT = 0.647). In lasso logistic regression models, areas under receiver operating characteristic curves, as measured by 5-fold cross-validation (AUCCV = 0.871) and against an external test set (AUCEXT = 0.917), indicated accurate classification of urine samples from the affected village and from a reference site. Ten candidate biomarkers identified at false discovery rates of <0.05 were associated with ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, possibly related to the disruption of small-molecule transport in the kidney; amino acid, porphyrin, and chlorophyll metabolism; and the heme biosynthetic pathway. Collectively, the results suggest that lead Pb is related to the health effects in individuals residing in ULAB site by alteration of these biological pathways.
