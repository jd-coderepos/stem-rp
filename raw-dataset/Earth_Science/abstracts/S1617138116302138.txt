In north-western Europe, deposition of atmospheric nitrogen is one of the main obstacles to maintaining or restoring natural habitats to a favourable conservation status. The Integrated Approach to Nitrogen (PAS) of the Netherlands is a national plan that combines generic source measures to reduce nitrogen emission levels and ecological restoration measures in Natura 2000 areas, while creating room for economic development. The aim of the PAS is to ensure that conservation objectives can be achieved, while further economic development is facilitated around Natura 2000 areas within strict environmental limits. In this way, the PAS connects economy and ecology. This paper examines the PAS from a societal, scientific, juridical and practical perspective, based on a study of the literature, juridical cases and first experiences of the programme. Our review indicated that the PAS is a comprehensive approach to the nitrogen issue, aiming for a balance between the societal, scientific, juridical and practical perspective. However, the programme has not yet been in force long enough to observe actual results in the field.
