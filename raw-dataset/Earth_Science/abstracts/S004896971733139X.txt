Ill-defined, multi-component mixtures of steroidal pharmaceuticals are present in the aquatic environment. Fish are extremely sensitive to some of these steroids. It is important to know how fish respond to these mixtures, and from that knowledge develop methodology that enables accurate prediction of those responses. To provide some of the data required to reach this objective, pairs of fish were first exposed to five different synthetic steroidal pharmaceuticals (one estrogen, EE2; one androgen, trenbolone; one glucocorticoid, beclomethasone dipropionate; and two progestogens, desogestrel and levonorgestrel) and concentration-response data on egg production obtained. Based on those concentration-response relationships, a five component mixture was designed and tested twice. Very similar effects were observed in the two experiments. The mixture inhibited egg production in an additive manner predicted better by the model of Independent Action than that of Concentration Addition. Our data provide a reference case for independent action in an in vivo model. A significant combined effect was observed when each steroidal pharmaceutical in the mixture was present at a concentration which on its own would produce no statistically significant effect (something from ‘nothing’). Further, when each component was present in the mixture at a concentration expected to inhibit egg production by between 18% (Beclomethasone diproprionate) and 40% (trenbolone), this mixture almost completely inhibited egg production: a phenomenon we term ‘a lot from a little’. The results from this proof-of-principle study suggest that multiple steroids present in the aquatic environment can be analysed for their potential combined environmental risk.
