Interest in renewable and clean energy over the past decade has motivated immense research on wind energy. The main issues in design of offshore wind turbines in regions of recent development have been aero- and hydro-dynamic loads; however, earthquake is a design concern in seismic areas such as East Asia and Western United states. This paper reviews the state of practice in seismic design of offshore wind turbines. It is demonstrated that wind turbines are in particular vulnerable to vertical earthquake excitation due to their rather high natural frequencies in vertical direction; however, inclusion of the radiation damping could contribute considerably reduce the earthquake loads. Moreover, it is demonstrated how soil nonlinearity could lead to settlement and permanent tilting of offshore wind turbines on caisson foundations or tripods. Using these cases, the paper demonstrates that the design of offshore wind turbines for earthquake loading is driven by performance-based considerations.
