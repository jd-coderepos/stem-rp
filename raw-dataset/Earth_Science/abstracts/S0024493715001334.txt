Permian metapegmatite muscovite from the Upper-Austroalpine Matsch Unit in Southern Tyrol (Italy) was investigated regarding its Rb/Sr and compositional retentivity during Cretaceous Upper-greenschist facies deformation. The data imply that microstructurally relic Permian magmatic muscovite largely maintained its major and trace element compositions during deformation, whereas the Rb/Sr geochronometer is strongly affected by a net loss of Sr. Lower Sr concentrations of muscovite correlate with higher 87Rb/86Sr and 87Sr/86Sr ratios. In most samples, the muscovite grain size- and magnetic-fractions with the lowest 87Rb/86Sr and 87Sr/86Sr ratios preserve a Permo-Triassic muscovite–whole rock Rb/Sr apparent age interpreted as to reflect formation during or cooling after pegmatite emplacement. Contrastingly, muscovite fractions with higher 87Rb/86Sr and 87Sr/86Sr ratios are arranged along a roughly linear array with a positive correlation of the 87Rb/86Sr and 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the 87Rb/86Sr vs 87Sr/86Sr space. They yield successively lower muscovite–whole rock Rb/Sr apparent ages. We explain the variations in the Rb/Sr isotopic character of microstructurally relic muscovite by a, presumably deformation-related, loss of Sr during the Cretaceous event. Contemporaneously, only very limited amounts of isotopically different Sr from the matrix reservoir might possibly have entered the muscovite. Consequently, the Rb/Sr of the relic muscovite is affected by a net loss of Sr. The results imply that at temperatures of <500°C, deformation is supposed to be the predominant factor in controlling the Rb/Sr geochronometer of relic muscovite, by significantly reducing the characteristic length scale for volume diffusion. However, variations of the major and trace element compositions within Permian relic muscovite are interpreted to rather reflect primary compositional instead of deformation-related variations.
