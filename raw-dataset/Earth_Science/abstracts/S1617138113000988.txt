In recent decades, nature conservation policies have increasingly considered the participation of various actors. However, the effectiveness of such efforts is often questionable, and better methods of engaging stakeholders are still being sought. In this paper, we present an analysis of a consultation program conducted in the final stage of site selection for Natura 2000 in Ma≈Çopolska, a region located in southern Poland. Based on a desk study and qualitative research, we analysed the modes and degrees of participation, the normative foundations of the consultation program, and the goals and expectations that characterise participants. The results are discussed using Unnestall's and Arnstein's typologies of participation, which show the limited success of the participatory process in representing all relevant stakeholders and enabling their actual influence on final decisions. The importance of implementing the EU directives for emerging multilevel governance in the nature conservation sector in Central and Eastern Europe, including Poland, is highlighted. In the context of Poland, the consultation program analysed appeared to be a novel and innovative step forward towards the development of a meaningful participatory approach in this region of Europe.
