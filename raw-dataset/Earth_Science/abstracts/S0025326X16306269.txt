The metals cadmium, mercury and lead, and the ICES7 CB levels were analysed in the common dab Limanda limanda to investigate whether concentrations of these determinants are at levels above established OSPAR assessment criteria around England and Wales. The results indicate that CB118 is above the OSPAR derived EAC at 22 out of 29 sampled stations, with 15 showing significant reductions. Cadmium is increasing significantly at six stations with two sites in the North Sea breaching corresponding OSPAR EAC. Mean results for all other PCBs and metals stayed below the EAC thresholds, with Hg concentrations even falling below BAC levels at South Eddystone located in the western English Channel. This study shows that PCBs banned over 20years ago are still found at concentrations in fish liver tissues which may pose a health risk to both the individual fish and their predators.
