A series of rock bolt pull tests were carried out in the laboratory to determine the critical embedment length of a specific type of fully cement-grouted rebar bolt. The rebar bolt is 20mm in diameter, and it is widely used in underground excavations in Norway. Three water-cement (w/c) ratios were used in the tests. It was discovered that the critical embedment length of the rock bolts was approximately 25cm for the water-cement ratio 0.40 (the corresponding uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of the grout is 37MPa), 32cm for the ratio 0.46 (UCS 32MPa), and 36cm for the ratio 0.50 (UCS 28MPa), for the specific type of cement, Rescon zinc rock bolt cement. It was found that the bond strength of the rock bolt is not a constant but is related to the embedment length. The bond strength was linearly proportional to the UCS of the grout.
