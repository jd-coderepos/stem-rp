Mining rock salt results in subsurface damage, which may affect the strength because of applied stress, anisotropy, and deformation rate. In this study, we used a Kolsky compression bar to measure the high strain rate response of bedded and domal salt at strain rates up to approximately 50 sâˆ’1 in parallel and perpendicular directions to bedding or foliation direction depending on rock salt type. Both types of salt exhibited a negative strain rate effect wherein a decrease in strength was observed with increasing strain rate compared to strength measured in the quasi-static regime. Both materials exhibited strength anisotropy. Fracturing and microfracturing were the dominant deformation mechanisms. High pore pressures and frictional heating due to the high loading rate may have contributed to reduction in strength.
