The Nile Delta is essential to Egypt’s agro- and socio-economy. Although surface water is the traditional source for Egypt’s irrigation, the shallow fresh groundwater resources underlying the delta are increasingly burdened by groundwater pumping, which increases interest in the status of the groundwater resources. Groundwater up to three times more saline than sea water was found at 600 m depth. The occurrence of this hypersaline groundwater raises doubts on the often-made assumption in the literature that seawater is the only source of salt in the Nile Delta aquifer and makes further investigation necessary. Knowledge on the origin of this hypersaline groundwater is key in assessing the possibility of deep fresh groundwater pockets. In this paper we conducted computational analyses to assess possible origins using both analytical solutions and numerical models. It is concluded that the hypersaline groundwater can either originate from Quaternary free convection systems, or from compaction-induced upward salt transport of hypersaline groundwater that formed during the Messinian salinity crisis. Our results also indicate that with groundwater dating it is possible to discriminate between these two hypotheses. Furthermore, it is deduced that the hydrological connection between aquifer and sea is crucial to the hydrogeological functioning of the Nile Delta Aquifer.
