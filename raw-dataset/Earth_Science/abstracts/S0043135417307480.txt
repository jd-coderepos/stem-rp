Clogging of streambeds by suspended particles (SP) can cause environmental problems, as it can negatively influence, e.g., habitats for macrozoobenthos, fish reproduction and groundwater recharge. This especially applies in the case of silt-sized SP. Until now, most research has dealt with coarse SP and was carried out in laboratory systems. The aims of this study are to examine (1) whether physical clogging by silt-sized SP exhibits the same dynamics and patterns as by sand-sized SP, and (2) the comparability of results between laboratory and field experiments. We carried out vertical column experiments with sand-sized bed material and silt-sized SP, which are rich in mica minerals. In laboratory experiments, we investigated the degree of clogging quantified by the reduction of porosity and hydraulic conductivity and the maximum clogging depth as a function of size and shape of bed material, size of SP, pore water flow velocity, and concentration of calcium cations. The SP were collected from an Alpine sedimentation basin, where our field experiments were carried out. To investigate the clogging process in the field, we buried columns filled with sand-sized quartz in the stream bed. We found that the maximal bed-to-grain ratio where clogging still occurs is larger for silt-sized SP than for sand-sized SP. The observed clogging depths and the reduction of flow rate through the column from our laboratory experiments were comparable to those from the field. However, our field results showed that the extent of clogging strongly depends on the naturally-occurring hydrological dynamics. The field location was characterized by a more polydisperse suspension, a strongly fluctuating water regime, and high SP concentrations at times, leading to more heterogeneous and more pronounced clogging when compared to laboratory results.
