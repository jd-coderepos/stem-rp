Distal volcano-tectonic (dVT) seismicity typically precedes eruption at long-dormant volcanoes by days to years. Precursory dVT seismicity may reflect magma-induced fluid-pressure pulses that intersect critically stressed faults. We explored this hypothesis using an open-source magmatic-hydrothermal code that simulates multiphase fluid and heat transport over the temperature range 0 to 1200°C. We calculated fluid-pressure changes caused by a small (0.04km3) intrusion and explored the effects of flow geometry (channelized vs. radial flow), magma devolatilization rates (0–15kg/s), and intrusion depths (5 and 7.5km, above and below the brittle-ductile transition). Magma and host-rock permeabilities were key controlling parameters and we tested a wide range of permeability (k) and permeability anisotropies (k h/k v), including k constant, k(z), k(T), and k(z, T, P) distributions, examining a total of ~1600 realizations to explore the relevant parameter space. Propagation of potentially causal pressure changes (ΔP ≥0.1 bars) to the mean dVT location (6km lateral distance, 6km depth) was favored by channelized fluid flow, high devolatilization rates, and permeabilities similar to those found in geothermal reservoirs (k ~10−16 to 10−13 m2). For channelized flow, magma-induced thermal pressurization alone can generate cases of ∆ P ≥0.1 bars for all permeabilities in the range 10−16 to 10−13 m2, whereas in radial flow regimes thermal pressurization causes ∆ P <0.1 bars for all permeabilities. Changes in distal fluid pressure occurred before proximal pressure changes given modest anisotropies (k h/k v ~10–100). Invoking k(z,T,P) and high, sustained devolatilization rates caused large dynamic fluctuations in k and P in the near-magma environment but had little effect on pressure changes at the distal dVT location. Intrusion below the brittle-ductile transition damps but does not prevent pressure transmission to the dVT site.
