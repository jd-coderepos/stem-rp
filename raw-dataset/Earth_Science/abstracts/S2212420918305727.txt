The aim of this paper is to understand the relationship between the types of losses incurred in the context of Storm Xaver, and the use of the term ‘disaster’ for a winter storm that occurred in 2013. This understanding is important as regards disaster risk reduction policy. This case study of the social-economic impact of Storm Xaver and the criteria that defined the 'disaster' in Poland, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands allows us the opportunity to understand and assess whether such a term is justified. This investigation reveals that affected populations are key when it comes to justifying the ‘disaster’ term. This study looks into those hidden meanings within the description for those affected by such a disaster, with quoted figures provided for the numbers of individuals affected subject to correction. However, it soon became clear the importance of separating the impact of such an event over the short and long-term as regards the study of disaster risk reduction on these groups. On the one hand, this case study reveals an imprecise use of the term ‘disaster’, and on the other misinformation in the numbers of those affected, which in turn leads to a misinterpretation in data and misleading optimism. If the approach is focused on "affected people" and the consequential effects of living in the area, then this can be used as a tool to put together more responsible activities for action towards Disaster Risk Reduction, e.g. an allocation of budget funds in the regions and locally.
