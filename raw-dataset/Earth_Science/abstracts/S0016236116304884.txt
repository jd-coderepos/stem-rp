There has been an increase in the use of biomass for power generation by means of co-firing with coal as well as by the combustion of 100% biomass. Despite the advantages of biomass in reducing carbon emissions from the electricity sector, the co-firing of high percentages of biomass can potentially aggravate ash related problems in the boiler. In order to develop mitigation strategies for the formation of deposits, an understanding of the ash behaviour during the combustion of high percentages of biomass is required. In this work, ash samples from El Cerrejon coal and pine biomass were characterised for their inorganic composition by X-ray fluorescence and wet chemical methods. Relationships between these two methods were found. Furthermore, the melting behaviour of ashes from pure coal, pine, and their blends were studied through ash fusion tests (AFT) and via a method using a simultaneous thermal analyser coupled to mass spectrometer (STA-MS) for the evolved gas analysis. Pine ash has lower slagging potential than El Cerrejon coal ash and results show that for 20:80 and 80:20 pine:coal ash belends the characteristic ash fusion temperatures increase with increasing pine ash content. There is unusually higher slagging potential (lower ash fusion temperatures) at a 50:50 blend ratio. Viscosity models produced sensible results for coal and coal/pine blends, but further refinement is required for modelling the viscosity of pure biomass ash. Thermodynamic modelling of slag formation was undertaken using the FactSage model. This model was successful in predicting the changes of gas, solid and liquid phases during pure pine, coal and co-combustion.
