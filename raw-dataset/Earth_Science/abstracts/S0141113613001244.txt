Many diatoms, a major class of unicellular algae contributing to over 45% of oceanic primary production, are known to induce deleterious effects on reproductive processes in crustacean copepods. This is mainly due to the production of teratogenic oxylipins, including polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs). Here we tested the direct effect of the PUA 2E,4E-decadienal (DD) on feeding activity, survivorship and reproductive success of the calanoid copepod Temora stylifera. DD-inoculated cultures induced high mortality at concentrations above 3 μg mL−1 compared to controls in both males and females, with males having a higher mortality. Low DD concentrations triggered an increase in female filtration and ingestion rates. Egg production rates and hatching times were also higher in the presence of DD, whereas egg hatching success decreased with increasing DD concentration. Our study shows, for the first time, that the presence of diatom PUAs may increase feeding rates in copepods.
