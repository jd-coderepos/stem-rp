This paper presents the theory and application of a code called CALLISTO which is used for performing NPP start-up and power ascension calculations. The CALLISTO code is designed to calculate various values relating to the neutron population of a nuclear system which contains a low number of neutrons. These variables include the moments of the PDF of the neutron population, the maturity time and the source multiplier. The code itself is based upon the mathematics presented in another paper and utilises representations of the neutron population which are independent of both space and angle but allows for the specification of an arbitrary number of energy groups. Five examples of the use of the code are presented. Comparison is performed against results found in the literature and the degree of agreement is discussed. In general the agreement is found to be good and, where it is not, plausible explanations for discrepancies are presented. The final two cases presented examine the effect of the number of neutron groups included and finds that, for the systems simulated, there is no significant difference in the key results of the code.
