While attention on the importance of closing materials loops for achieving circular economy (CE) is raging, the technicalities of doing so are often neglected or difficult to overcome. These technicalities determine the ability of materials, components and products (MCPs) to be properly recovered and redistributed for reuse, recycling or recovery, given their remaining functionality, described here as the remaining properties and characteristics of MCPs. The different properties of MCPs make them useful for various functions and purposes. A transition, therefore, towards a CE would require the utmost exploitation of the remaining functionality of MCPs; ideally, enabling recirculation of them back in the economy. At present, this is difficult to succeed. This short communication article explains how the remaining functionality of MCPs, defined here as quality, is perceived at different stages of the supply chain, focusing specifically on plastic packaging, and how this affects their potential recycling. It then outlines the opportunities and constraints posed by some of the interventions that are currently introduced into the plastic packaging system, aimed at improving plastic materials circularity. Finally, the article underpins the need for research that integrates systemic thinking, with technological innovations and policy reforms at all stages of the supply chain, to promote sustainable practices become established.
