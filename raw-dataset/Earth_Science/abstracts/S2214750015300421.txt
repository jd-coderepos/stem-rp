Keeping in mind the beneficial effects of GTE administration on liver damage, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of green tea extract (GTE) against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injuries in male hamsters for 8 weeks. Twenty hamsters were equally divided into 4 groups, the control ones (group I) received only dis. water. Hamsters of group II had free access to 10% of GTE, while hamsters of group III received 1ml/kg of 50% CCl4 in corn oil via gavage daily. Hamsters of group IV (GTE+CCl4) received a free access to GTE supplementation in combination with 1ml/kg of 50% CCl4 in corn oil via gavage daily. Lipid profile, hepatic enzyme levels and apoptosis molecular marker (p53) were investigated in hamsters. GTE+CCl4 treated hamsters showed lower levels of hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) than CCl4 exposed hamsters. Hepatic activity levels of GSH, ALD and cytochrome 450 reductase were declined after CCl4 administration while they were remarkably improved with GTE administration. Serum lipid profiles as T-cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) were improved in GTE and CCl4 treated hamsters than CCl4 group. Moreover, hepatic tissue damage and p53 expression induced with CCl4 were improved with the treatment of GTE. These results suggested that GTE possesses hepatoprotective properties against the effect of CCl4.
