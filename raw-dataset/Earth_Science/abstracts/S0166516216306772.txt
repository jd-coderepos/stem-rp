The liptinite maceral group has been revised by ICCP in accordance with the ICCP System 1994. After the revision of the classifications of vitrinite (ICCP, 1998), inertinite, (ICCP, 2001) and huminite (Sykorova et al., 2005) this liptinite classification completes the revised ICCP maceral group classifications. These classifications are collectively referred to as the “ICCP System 1994”. In contrast to the previous ICCP Stopes Heerlen (ICCP, 1963, 1971, 1975, 1993) this new classification system is applicable to coal of all ranks and dispersed organic matter. The classification as presented here was accepted in the ICCP Plenary Session on September 11, 2015 at the ICCP Meeting in Potsdam. The decision to publish this classification in the recent form was accepted at the ICCP Plenary Session on September 23, 2016 in Houston.
