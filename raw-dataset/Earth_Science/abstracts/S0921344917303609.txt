The aim of this study is to develop a BIM-based Whole-life Performance Estimator (BWPE) for appraising the salvage performance of structural components of buildings right from the design stage. A review of the extant literature was carried out to identify factors that influence salvage performance of structural components of buildings during their useful life. Thereafter, a mathematical modelling approach was adopted to develop BWPE using the identified factors and principle/concept of Weibull reliability distribution for manufactured products. The model was implemented in Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment and it was tested using case study design. Accordingly, the whole-life salvage performance profiles of the case study building were generated. The results show that building design with steel structure, demountable connections, and prefabricated assemblies produce recoverable materials that are mostly reusable. The study reveals that BWPE is an objective means for determining how much of recoverable materials from buildings are reusable and recyclable at the end of its useful life. BWPE will therefore provide a decision support mechanism for the architects and designers to analyse the implication of designs decision on the salvage performance of buildings over time. It will also be useful to the demolition engineers and consultants to generate pre-demolition audit when the building gets to end of its life.
