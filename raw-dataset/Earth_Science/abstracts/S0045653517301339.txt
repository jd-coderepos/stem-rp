This study presents the characterization of the gas-particle partition and size distribution of seven parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in ambient air samples collected in the proximity of oil sands exploration and compares their time-integrated concentration levels with nineteen analogous oxidation products - quinones. Gas-phase (GP) and particle-phase (PM) ambient air aerosol samples that were collected separately in summer for either 24 h or 12 h (day and night) revealed a higher PAH partition in the GP than in the PM, with the distribution over tenfold higher for light over heavy PAHs. Diurnal/nocturnal samples demonstrated that night conditions lead to lower concentrations, linking some of the sources of these compounds with daytime activity emissions. PAHs were observed to transform more efficiently in the GP, and quinone levels increased in the PM with time. Correlation data indicated that parent PAHs originated from primary emission sources associated with oil sand activities and that quinone formation paralleled a reduction in PAH levels. The findings of this study shed new light on characterization of PAHs in the Athabasca oil sands region.
