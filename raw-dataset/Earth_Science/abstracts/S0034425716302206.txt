Covering 40% of the terrestrial surface, dryland ecosystems characteristically have distinct vegetation structures that are strongly linked to their function. Existing survey approaches cannot provide sufficiently fine-resolution data at landscape-level extents to quantify this structure appropriately. Using a small, unpiloted aerial system (UAS) to acquire aerial photographs and processing theses using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry, three-dimensional models were produced describing the vegetation structure of semi-arid ecosystems at seven sites across a grassâ€“to shrub transition zone. This approach yielded ultra-fine (<1cm2) spatial resolution canopy height models over landscape-levels (10ha), which resolved individual grass tussocks just a few cm3 in volume. Canopy height cumulative distributions for each site illustrated ecologically-significant differences in ecosystem structure. Strong coefficients of determination (r2 from 0.64 to 0.95) supported prediction of above-ground biomass from canopy volume. Canopy volumes, above-ground biomass and carbon stocks were shown to be sensitive to spatial changes in the structure of vegetation communities. The grain of data produced and sensitivity of this approach is invaluable to capture even subtle differences in the structure (and therefore function) of these heterogeneous ecosystems subject to rapid environmental change. The results demonstrate how products from inexpensive UAS coupled with SfM photogrammetry can produce ultra-fine grain biophysical data products, which have the potential to revolutionise scientific understanding of ecology in ecosystems with either spatially or temporally discontinuous canopy cover.
