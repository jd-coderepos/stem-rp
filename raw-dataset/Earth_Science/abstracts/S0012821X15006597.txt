One of the key processes for modulating ice flow is the interaction between the ice and the bed, but direct observations of the subglacial environment are sparse and difficult to obtain. In this study we use information from an extensive radio-echo sounding dataset to identify areas of the Greenland Ice Sheet where internal layers have been influenced by near-bed processes. Based on an automatic algorithm for calculating the slope of the internal radio-echo layers, we identify areas with disrupted layer stratigraphy. We find that large parts of the northern portion of the ice sheet are influenced by locally confined mechanisms that produce up-warping or folds in the layer stratigraphy inconsistent with the surface and bed topography. This is particularly evident at the onset of ice streams, although less dynamic areas close to the ice divide also contain imprints of layer disturbances. Our results show that the disturbances are found in many different flow and thermal regimes, and underscore the need to understand the mechanisms responsible for creating them.
