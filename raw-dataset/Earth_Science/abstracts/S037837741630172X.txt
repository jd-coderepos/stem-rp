Farm crop growing and high efficiency water resource utilizing are directly influenced by global warming, and a new challenge will be given to food and water resource security. A simulation experiment by farm warming with infrared ray radiator was carried out, and the result showed photosynthesis of broad bean was significantly faster than transpiration during the seedling stage, ramifying stage, budding stage, blooming stage and podding stage when the temperate was increased by 0.5–1.5°C. But broad bean transpiration was faster than photosynthesis during the budding stage, blooming stage and podding stage when the temperature was increased by 1.5°C above. The number of grain per hill and hundred-grain weight were significantly increased when the temperature was increased by 0.5–1.0°C. But they significantly dropped and finally the yield decreased when the temperature was increased by 1.0°C above. The broad bean yield decreased by 39.2–88.4% when the temperature was increased by 1.5–2.0°C. The broad bean water use efficiency increased and then decreased with temperature rising. The water use efficiency increased when the temperature was increased by 1.0°C below, and it quickly decreased when the temperature was increased by 1.0°C above. In all, global warming in the future will significantly influence the growth, yield and water use efficiency of bean cultures in China’s semiarid regions.
