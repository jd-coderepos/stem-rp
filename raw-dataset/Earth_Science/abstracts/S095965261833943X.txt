Sustainable management in the biogas production via anaerobic digestion process intents the use of alternative biomass sources that are not competitive with food production. The aim of this study is to investigate the application of the abundant-quantity residue in more sustainable production of heat and electricity along with the production of the digested substrate as a fertiliser. The study has been divided into several sequential steps. First, the grass samples have been collected at the following locations: uncultivated land, river embankment and highway verge. The greatest grass yield has been determined for the riverbank grass, with an average value of 19 t/ha of fresh mass and 2.6 t/ha of dry mass. Next, the chemical characterisation of the collected residue grass and the laboratory batch mono and co-digestion tests with maize silage and cattle slurry have been conducted. The results show that all grass samples have satisfying digestive parameters (C/N ratio between 16.6:1 to 22.8:1) with the low presence of impurities, which makes them suitable for biogas production. The following biochemical methane potential in mono-digestion of residue grass has been recorded: uncultivated land (0.275 Nm3/kgTS), riverbank (0.192 Nm3/kgTS) and highway verge (0.255 Nm3/kgTS). The control of the process has been improved in co-digestion tests, by avoiding acidification in the first days of the operation. The estimation of kinetic parameters in mathematical modelling has shown that the degradation of residue grass shows some different parameters compared to the previous study. The model results for the gas phase show some small deviations compared to the experimental data. Based on the life cycle analysis results it can be concluded that there are perspectives in the use of residual grass compared to maize silage in the production of heat and electricity, especially in the improvement of ecosystem quality.
