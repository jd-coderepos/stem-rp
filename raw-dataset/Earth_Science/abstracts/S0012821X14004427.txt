Analyses of Ps and Sp receiver functions from datasets collected by permanent and temporary seismic stations, image a seismic discontinuity, due to a negative velocity contrast across the entire Eastern Alps. The receiver functions show the presence of the discontinuity within the upper mantle with a resolution of tens of kilometers laterally. It is deeper (100–130 km) below the central portion of the Eastern Alps, and shallower (70–80 km) towards the Pannonian Basin and in the Central Alps. Comparison with previous studies renders it likely that the observed discontinuity coincides with the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary (LAB) east of 15°E longitude, while it could be associated with a low velocity zone west of 15°E.
