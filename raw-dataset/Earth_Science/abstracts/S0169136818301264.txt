The Skouries deposit is a platinum-group element (PGE) enriched Cu-Au porphyry system located in the Chalkidiki peninsula, Greece, with associated Ag, Bi and Te enrichment. The deposit is hosted by multiple porphyritic monzonite and syenite intrusions, which originated from a magma chamber at depth. An initial quartz monzonite porphyritic intrusion contains a quartz–magnetite ± chalcopyrite–pyrite vein stockwork with intense potassic alteration. The quartz monzonite intrusion is cross cut by a set of syenite and mafic porphyry dykes and quartz–chalcopyrite–bornite ± magnetite veins which host the majority of the Cu and Au mineralisation. Late stage quartz–pyrite veins, with associated phyllic alteration crosscut all previous vein generations. Electron microprobe and scanning electron microscopy shows that the PGE are hosted by platinum-group minerals (PGM) in the quartz-chalcopyrite–bornite ± magnetite veins and within potassic alteration assemblages. The PGE mineralisation in Skouries is therefore part of the main high temperature hypogene mineralisation event. Platinum-group minerals at Skouries include: sopcheite [Ag4Pd3Te4], merenskyite [(Pd,Pt)(Te,Bi)2] and kotulskite [Pd(Te,Bi)], with rare telargpalite [(Pd,Ag)3Te], isomertieite [Pd11Sb2As2], naldrettite [Pd2Sb], testibiopalladite [PdTe(Sb,Te)] and sobolevskite [PdBi]. The most common platinum-group mineral is sopcheite. The PGM in Skouries are small, 52 µm2 on average, and occur as spherical grains on the boundaries between sulphides and silicates, and as inclusions within hydrothermal quartz and sulphides. These observations support a “semi-metal collector model” whereby an immiscible Bi-Te melt acts as a collector for PGE and other precious metals in high temperature hydrothermal fluids. This mechanism would allow the formation of PGM in porphyries without Pt and Pd fluid saturation.
