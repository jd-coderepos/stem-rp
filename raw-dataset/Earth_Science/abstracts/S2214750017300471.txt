Andrographis paniculata, “King of bitters” is a popularly known medicinal plant extensively used in many parts of the world for treatment of various diseases. Since recent past, anaphylactic/allergic type adverse events were reported upon A. paniculata usage, the study aimed to evaluate the anaphylactic and anaphylactoid potential of A. paniculata extract and andrographolide (a major phytoactive of A. paniculata). The anaphylactic potential was evaluated using active systemic anaphylaxis (ASA) assay in guinea pigs. Further, the release of allergic mediators was measured in immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitized and non-IgE sensitized Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL-2H3) cell lines in-vitro. A. paniculata extract or andrographolide sensitized guinea pigs following the challenge antigen administration orally and intravenously did not demonstrate any clinical signs of anaphylaxis. IgE sensitized and non- IgE sensitized RBL-2H3 cells treated with A. paniculata extract did not induce release of allergic mediators. Whereas IgE sensitized and non- IgE sensitized RBL-2H3 cells treated with andrographolide demonstrated mild to moderate release of allergic mediators. A. paniculata extract has no anaphylactic and anaphylactoid potential in in-vivo and in-vitro studies. Whereas, andrographolide effects on allergic mediators in in-vitro studies needs to be scrutinized if they are of biologically important.
