The well characterized oxygen-isotopic fractionation during cellulose biosynthesis has been utilised by numerous studies of stable isotopes in fine-grained aquatic cellulose. We measured the δ13Ccellulose and δ18Ocellulose values of bulk cellulose and moss fragments from an ∼11.4ka-long core obtained from a shallow, productive, spring-fed, hardwater lake, Äntu Sinijärv, Estonia (59˚3.8′N; 26˚14.5′E; 94.6 m a.s.l.; maximum depth 7.3 m), in order to reconstruct regional Holocene climate and lake-basin evolution. Isotopically, the modern waterbody is a well-behaved, open, hydrological system with negligible evaporative effects. Cellulose-isotope records were compared with down-core measurements of loss-on-ignition (LOI), carbonate and mineral contents, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N ratio, δ13CTOC, biomarker indices (Palg and Paq), published palaeoecological data and a δ18Ocarbonate record from the same palaeolake. Green microalgae, freshwater macroalgae (Chara) and aquatic bryophytes were important sources of sedimentary cellulose during different phases in the environmental history of the lake. Although a strong palaeoclimatic imprint can be detected in the δ18Ocellulose record from Äntu Sinijärv, notably the Preboreal oscillation, the 8.2ka event and an unnamed cold oscillation ∼3.25ka BP, the isotopic signal of these events may have been amplified by increases in 18O-depleted spring snowmelt. In contrast, δ13Ccellulose was tightly coupled to the Holocene evolution of terrestrial ecosystems and soils by significant inputs of biogenic carbon from the catchment and sublacustrine springs. During the early Holocene, ∼11 – 9ka BP, the δ18Ocellulose and δ18Ocarbonate records diverge markedly, which can be attributed to “no-analogue” seasonal, climatic, hydrological and isotopic conditions resulting from orbital forcing and residual ice-sheet impacts.
