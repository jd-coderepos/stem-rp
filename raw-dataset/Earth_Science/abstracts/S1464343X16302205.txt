Sm-Nd garnet-whole rock geochronology and phase equilibria modeling have been used to determine the age and conditions of regional metamorphism within the Tasriwine ophiolite complex, Sirwa, Morocco. Pressure and temperature estimates obtained using a NaCaKFMASHT phase diagram (pseudosection) and garnet core and rim compositions predict that garnet growth began at ∼0.72 GPa and ∼615 °C and ended at ∼0.8 GPa and ∼640 °C. A bulk garnet Sm-Nd age of 647.2 ± 1.7 Ma, calculated from a four point isochron that combines whole rock, garnet full dissolution and two successively more aggressive partial dissolutions, provides a precise date for garnet formation and regional metamorphism. The age is over 15 million years younger than a previous age estimate of regional metamorphism of 663 ± 13 Ma based upon a SHRIMP U-Pb date from rims on zircon from the Iriri migmatite. The new data provide further constraints on the age and nature of regional metamorphism in the Anti-Atlas mountains and emphasizes that garnet growth during regional metamorphism may not necessarily coincide with magmatism/anatexis which predominate the signature witnessed by previous U-Pb studies. The ability to couple PT estimates for garnet formation with high precision Sm-Nd geochronology highlights the utility of garnet studies for uncovering the detailed metamorphic history of the Anti-Atlas mountain belt.
