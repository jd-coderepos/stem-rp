The LRVs required to decrease HE concentrations in raw sewage to an acceptable level to manage the risk to human and livestock health were determined. An LRV of 3.0 was required to meet the HBT of 1 μDALY pppy in SE Australia where human helminth infections are not endemic. In comparison, a similar exposure volume and LRV in endemic regions would result in a HBT of 100 μDALY pppy. The risks posed by cattle- and pig-related helminths were also managed acceptably with the treatment of sewage providing an LRV of 3.0. New design equations were derived to determine LRVs based on hydraulic residence times (HRTs) in an activated sludge plant (ASP) and lagoons. The new equation for lagoons indicated that an LRV of 3.0 could be achieved with a HRT of 18 days or less.
