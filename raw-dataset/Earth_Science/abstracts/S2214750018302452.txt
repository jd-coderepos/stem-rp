The methanol extracts of both leaves and fruits (MEL & MEF) of A. marmelos (L.) Correa (family Rutaceae) were analyzed by using analytical method based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The objective of this study was to identify the active constituents of (MEL & MEF) of A. marmelos. Six, alkaloids namely aeglemarmelosine, marmesiline aegelinoside, shahidine, anhydromarmeline and N-2-methoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl) ethylcinnamide and two flavonoids, rutin and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside in leaves were identified. Two alkaloids marmesiline and shahidine in the methanol extracts of fruits, also have been identified. Moreover, the efficiency of extracts was performed for measuring the reducing hepatotoxicity effect induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in mice. Accordingly, several biochemical parameters were performed such as lipid profile in serum, liver functions enzyme activities, glycolytic enzyme activities. In addition, LDH and SDH were investigated. The results obtained demonstrated, significant increase in lipid profile, liver function biomarkers in addition to glycolytic enzyme activities in CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity. Histopathological examination confirmed the biochemical results. Treatment of intoxicated mice with (MEL & MEF) of A. marmelos showed amelioration signs in biochemical findings as well as at cellular level. It could be concluded that both MEL & MEF can be used clinically for their potential effect as a hepatoprotective that normalized liver function biomarkers, hepatic architecture and restore physiologically status of the body against CCl4 intoxication.
