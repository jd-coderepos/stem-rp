It is very challenging to fuse remote sensing images with significant spatial resolution difference. In this paper, such kind of images are fusing with one posteriori probability model for the purpose of creating thematic maps. The outlined solution consists of parsing the low spatial resolution multispectral images into intensity-hue-saturation triples with spatial and spectral properties separated; the contribution of the old intensity and the panchromatic image is factorized into posteriori probabilities using their wavelet planes under the aid of support vector machine; the wavelet planes are probabilistically weighted to foresee one new pan-sharpened intensity, from which the fused images are produced by inverse IHS. The outlined method along with two representative methods are evaluated with two sets of imagery covering contrasting heterogeneous landscapes for different purposes of road extraction and wheat area map.
