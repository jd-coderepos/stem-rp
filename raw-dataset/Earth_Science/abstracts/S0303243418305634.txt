Reduced availability of plant nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) has detrimental effects on plant growth. Plant N:P ratio, calculated as the quotient of N and P concentrations, is an ecological indicator of relative N and P limitation. Remote sensing has already been widely used to detect plant traits in foliage, particularly canopy N and P concentrations and could be used to detect canopy N:P faster and at lower cost than traditional destructive methods. Despite the potential opportunity of applying remote sensing techniques to detect canopy N:P, studies investigating canopy N:P remote detection are scarce. In this study, we examined if vegetation indices developed for canopy N or P detection can also be used for canopy N:P detection. Using in situ spectrometry, we measured the reflectance of a common grass species, Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus L.), grown under different nutrient ratios and levels. We calculated 60 VIs found in literature and compared them to optimized VIs developed specifically for this study. The VIs were calculated using both the original narrow band spectra and the spectra resampled to the band properties of six satellite sensors (MSI – Sentinel 2, OLCI – Sentinel 3, MODIS – Terra/Aqua, OLI – Landsat 8, WorldView 4 and RapidEye) to investigate the influence of bandwidths and band positions. The results showed that canopy N:P was significantly related to both existing VIs (r2 = 0.16 - 0.48) and optimized VIs (r2 = 0.59 – 0.72) with correlations similar to what was observed for canopy N or canopy P. Existing VIs calculated with MSI and OLI sensors bands showed higher correlation with canopy N:P compared to the other sensors while the correlation with optimized VIs was not affected by the differences in sensors’ bands. This study might lead to future practical applications using in situ reflectance measurements to sense canopy N:P in grasslands.
