The impact of wind waves and salt marsh erosion on sediment transport dynamics of macro-tidal estuarine systems has been examined using a numerical model. Morphological changes associated with salt marsh erosion facilitate the propagation of waves to the marsh edges, and increase the resuspension and export of sediments from the estuary. Results also highlight the impact of tidally-modulated changes in wave action upon sediment transport dynamics throughout a tidal cycle and from neap to spring tide. In particular, wave action at the landward margin of the estuary is limited by the shallow water depth, and tidally induced increments in water depth only cause a modest increase in wave shear stresses. At the seaward side of the domain, the impact of waves is limited by the deeper water, and tidally induced water level variations have a more significant control on wave shear stresses. The outcomes contribute new insights that are important for the sediment budget of macro-tidal estuaries facing climate change and have implications for the long-term morphological evolution of estuarine wetlands.
