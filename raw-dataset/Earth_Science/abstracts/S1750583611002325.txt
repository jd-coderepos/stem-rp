Iron oxyhydroxide, goethite (α-FeOOH), was evaluated as a potential formation mineral reactant for trapping CO2 in a mineral phase such as siderite (FeCO3), when a mixture of CO2–SO2 flue gas is injected into a saline aquifer. Two thermodynamic simulations were conducted, equilibrating a CO2–SO2 fluid mixture with a NaCl-brine and Fe-rich rocks at 150°C and 300bar. The modeling studies evaluated mineral and fluid composition at equilibrium and the influence of pH buffering in the system. Results show siderite precipitates both in the buffered and unbuffered system; however, the presence of an alkaline pH buffer enhances the stability of the carbonate. Based on the model, an experiment was designed to compare with thermodynamic predictions. A CO2–SO2 gas mixture was reacted in 150ml of NaCl–NaOH brine containing 10g of goethite at 150°C and 300bar for 24 days. Mineralogical and brine chemistry confirmed siderite as the predominant reaction product in the system. Seventy-six mg of CO2 are sequestered in siderite per 10g of goethite.
