A series of monomeric and dimeric FeIII complexes with O,O-; O,N-; O,S-coordination motifs has been prepared and characterized by standard analytical methods in order to elucidate their potential to act as model compounds for aquatic humic acids. Due to the postulated reduction of iron in humic acids and following uptake by microorganisms, the redox behavior of the models was investigated with cyclic voltammetry. Most of the investigated compounds showed iron reduction potentials accessible to biological reducing agents. Additionally, observed reduction processes were predominantly irreversible, suggesting that subsequent reactions can take place after reduction of the iron center. Also the stability of the synthesized complexes in pure water and artificial seawater was monitored from 24h up to 21days by means of UV–Vis spectrometry. Several complexes remained stable even after 21days, showing only partially precipitation but some of them showed changes in UV–Vis spectra already after 24h which were connected to protonation/deprotonation processes as well as redox processes and degradation of the complexes. The ability to act as an iron source for primary producers was tested in algal growth experiments with two marine algae species Chlorella salina and Prymnesium parvum. Some of the compounds showed effects on the algal cultures, which are comparable with natural humic acids and better as for the samples kept under ideal conditions. Those findings help to understand which functional groups of humic acids could be responsible for the reversible iron binding and transport in aquatic humic substances.
