This paper presents a novel control rod treatment for finite element method (FEM) based reactor physics simulations. The new method falls into the class of homogenization methods which treat material interfaces in mesh elements by defining a representative, homogenized nuclear cross section set. In contrast to existing homogenization based cusping treatments that attempt to approximate flux-volume weighting of the cross sections, we propose to exactly integrate terms appearing in the variational form of the transport or diffusion equation over mixed material elements. This goal is achieved by defining smoothly varying cross sections in elements that straddle material boundaries. It is shown that the smoothly varying cross sections can be obtained by projecting the piecewise set of cross sections onto the set of Legendre polynomials up to a finite order. Implementation of smoothly varying cross sections is supported within the Rattlesnake radiation multiphysics code at the Idaho National Laboratory. Homogenization methods traditionally suffer from cusping effects that originate from overestimation of absorption cross sections in strongly neutron-absorbing materials as found in control rods. We demonstrate that the presented method is (1) highly effective in removing cusping effects and (2) provides accurate results based on the C5G7-TD benchmark, a time-dependent version of the C5G7 benchmark.
