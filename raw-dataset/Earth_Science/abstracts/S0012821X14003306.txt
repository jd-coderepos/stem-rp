The Tyrrhenian Sea in the Mediterranean formed as the result of roll-back of the Adriatic and Ionian subducting plates. It is mostly underlain by strongly thinned continental lithosphere, but contains two small oceanic basins in the southern Tyrrhenian, the youngest one located just behind the active magmatic arc. Its regional setting with dense station coverage provides a unique opportunity to derive a high-resolution, 3-D shear-velocity model of this back-arc basin and surrounding onshore areas using interstation Rayleigh-wave dispersion measurements. Our tomographic model, extending to a depth of approximately 160 km, displays a pronounced, nearly ring-shaped low shear-velocity zone between 70 and 110 km depth which surrounds the older oceanic Vavilov Basin. The sharp velocity decrease at 70 km depth can be explained by the transition from a relatively dry lithospheric mantle to more hydrous asthenospheric mantle material. The tectonic evolution of the region and the correlation of the low-velocity anomaly with subduction-related volcanism indicate that the low-velocity anomaly reflects hydrous mantle material in (present or former) mantle wedge regions. We suggest that the absence of the low-velocity zone beneath the Vavilov Basin is due to mantle dehydration caused by the creation of MORB crust. Whereas temperature effects may dominate the asthenospheric shear-velocity differences between various back-arc basins, we find that the variations in shear-velocity structure within the Tyrrhenian area are best explained by variations in mantle water content.
