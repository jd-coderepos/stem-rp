Identifying the lacustrine haptophyte species that produce long-chain alkenones (LCAs) is essential prior to down-core temperature reconstructions. Here, we investigated the identity of LCA-producing species from Lake Toyoni, Japan using 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and organic geochemical analyses. The rDNA analyses identified eighteen operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of which only one fell within the haptophyte phylotype. This haptophyte belongs to the Group I phylotype, as supported by the LCA distribution found in surface and down-core sediments, and is closely related to a haptophyte found in Lake BrayaSø (Greenland). The inferred temperature using the Greenland calibration is very close to the Lake Toyoni surface temperature recorded during the spring/early summer season, when the LCA-producing haptophyte is likely to bloom. We therefore suggest that the temperature calibration from the Lake BrayaSø, Greenland is a suitable calibration for down-core temperature reconstructions at Lake Toyoni.
