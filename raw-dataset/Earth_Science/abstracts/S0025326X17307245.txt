Trace metal concentrations in muscle and liver tissues from two offshore species of skate were examined. Concentrations of mercury in muscle of Leucoraja circularis (n=20; 23–110.5cm total length, 157–490m water depth) and L. fullonica (n=24; 28.5–100cm total length, 130–426m water depth) were 0.02–1.8 and 0.04–0.61mgkg−1, respectively. Concentrations of both As and Hg increased with total length. Only the largest specimen had a concentration of Hg in muscle >1.0mgkg−1. Data were limited for specimens>90cm long, and further studies on contaminants in larger-bodied skates could usefully be undertaken.
