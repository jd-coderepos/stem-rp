Cl partition coefficients between forsterite, enstatite and coexisting Cl-bearing aqueous fluids were determined in a series of high pressure and temperature piston cylinder experiments at 2GPa between 900 and 1300°C in the system MgO–SiO2–H2O–NaCl–BaO–C±CaCl2±TiO2±Al2O3±F. Diamond aggregates were added to the experimental capsule set-up in order to separate the fluid from the solid residue and enable in situ analysis of the quenched solute by LA-ICP-MS. The chlorine content of forsterite and enstatite was measured by electron microprobe, and the nature of hydrous defects was investigated by infrared spectroscopy. Partition coefficients show similar incompatibility for Cl in forsterite and enstatite, with D Cl fo/fl =0.0012±0.0006, D Cl en/fl =0.0018±0.0008 and D Cl fo/en =1.43±0.71. The values determined for mineral/fluid partitioning are very similar to previously determined values for mineral/melt. Applying the new mineral/fluid partition coefficients to fluids in subduction zones, a contribution between 0.15% and 20% of the total chlorine from the nominally anhydrous minerals is estimated. Infrared spectra of experimental forsterite show absorption bands at 3525 and 3572cm−1 that are characteristic for hydroxyl point defects associated with trace Ti substitutions, and strongly suggest that the TiO2 content of the system can influence the chlorine and OH incorporation via the stabilization of Ti-clinohumite-like point defects. The water contents for coexisting forsterite and enstatite in some runs were determined using unpolarized IR spectra and calculated water partition coefficients D H 2 O fo / en are between 0.01 and 0.5.
