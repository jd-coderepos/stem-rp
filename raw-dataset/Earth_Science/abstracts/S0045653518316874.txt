Several recent studies have reported evidence that surface mining operations of bitumen in northern Alberta's oil sands (OS) region contribute significantly to the atmospheric deposition of metals and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) within the vicinity of OS development. The present study examines the accumulation of PACs in boreal wetlands at varying distance from OS industrial activities with the use of semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) and wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpoles. SPMDs were deployed in shallow lentic waterbodies adjacent to wood frog egg masses and were retrieved, along with tadpoles, approximately 35–45 days later. The highest concentrations of PACs were detected in SPMDs deployed within a 25 km radius of surface mining activity, consistent with snow deposition studies of PACs in the region. In wetlands located within the vicinity of surface mining activity, PAC profiles of SPMDs and wood frog tadpoles were dominated by C1-C4 alkylated PACs, including alkylated dibenzothiophenes, which are strongly indicative of petrogenic sources. Contrary to differences seen in the SPMD PAC concentrations, there were no obvious differences in the ∑PACs in wood frog tissue between wetland study sites, although alkylated fluorenes were found to be higher in tadpoles collected from a wetland located within 10 km of two bitumen upgrading facilities. The use of SPMDs in tandem with wood frog tadpoles can help assess the potential exposure of aquatic organisms to PACs in boreal wetlands.
