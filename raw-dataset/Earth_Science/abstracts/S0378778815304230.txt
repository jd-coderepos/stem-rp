Energy signatures for air conditioning systems can have characteristics which are not seen with heating systems. This paper explains and illustrates some of the characteristics that are specific to air conditioning systems and describes how energy signatures that take account of them can be applied to produce benchmarks, control charts and diagnostic information. It focusses on the use of energy signatures derived from measured daily system energy consumption. Daily energy signatures can generate more robust energy consumption benchmarks and provide additional insight into unusual energy demand patterns compared to monthly or weekly signatures, albeit requiring slightly more data. In particular, they distinguish between weekday and weekend consumptions. They can be used to generate benchmarks based on standardised annual consumption or standardised annual load factor. In addition they can be used to generate control charts to identify days of unusual consumption for individual systems. More sets of daily energy consumption data are needed to evaluate their diagnostic power.
