Hydrogen production from waste plastics is an important alternative for managing waste plastics. This work addresses a promising technology for co-producing high value carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in addition to the production of hydrogen; thus significantly increasing the economic feasibility of the process. Catalyst design is a critical factor to control the production of hydrogen and CNTs. NiMnAl catalysts, prepared by a co-precipitation method, with different metal molar ratios were developed and investigated using a two-stage fixed-bed reactor. It was found that the NiMnAl catalyst with the higher Mn content produced a higher yield of carbon (57.7wt.%). Analysis of the carbon on the NiMnAl catalysts showed it to consist of â¿¼90wt.% of carbon nanotubes. The CNTs were recovered from the catalyst and added at 2wt.% to LDPE plastic to form a composite material. The tensile and flexural strength and the tensile and flexural modulus of the CNT composite material were significantly improved by the addition of the recovered CNTs. Thus it is suggested that cost-effective CNTs could be produced from waste plastics as by-product of the production of hydrogen, enhancing the potential applications of CNTs in the composite industry.
