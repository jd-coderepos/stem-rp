This study investigated the simultaneous removal of Sr2+ and 14CO3 2− from pH>12 Ca(OH)2 solution by the precipitation of calcium carbonate. Initial Ca2+:CO3 2− ratios ranged from 10:1 to 10:100 (mM:mM). Maximum removal of 14C and Sr2+ both occurred in the system containing 10mM Ca2+ and 1mM CO3 2− (99.7% and 98.6% removal respectively). A kinetic model is provided that describes 14C and Sr removal in terms of mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions. The removal of 14C was achieved during the depletion of the initial TIC in solution, and was subsequently significantly affected by recrystallization of the calcite precipitate from an elongate to isotropic morphology. This liberated >46% of the 14C back to solution. Sr2+ removal occurred as Ca2+ became depleted in solution and was not significantly affected by the recrystallization process. The proposed reaction could form the basis for low cost remediation scheme for 90Sr and 14C in radioactively contaminated waters (<$0.25 reagent cost per m3 treated).
