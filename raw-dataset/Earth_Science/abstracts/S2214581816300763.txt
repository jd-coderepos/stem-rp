Region Upper Zambezi catchment and the river flow gauge at Kafue Hook (13.4S, 27.8E), typified by gentle topography and a strong seasonal cycle. Focus Evaluation of satellite and model estimates of hydro-meteorology conditions using data in the period 1998–2015, to supplement the very limited operational reports coming from the region. Insights Satellite soil moisture and model run-off track the Kafue Hook gauge with correlation values of 84% and 68%, respectively. Satellite river flow estimates achieve a logarithmic fit to monthly and daily gauge of 92% and 65%, respectively. Discrepancies are related to inadequate (calibration) reporting and to under-estimation of evaporation in the dry season. Statistical analyses of satellite rainfall and model evaporation are used to suggest improvements to hydro-meteorology network coverage in the upper Zambezi. An automated online network of ∼20 weather stations and river flow gauges appears sufficient, given satellite-model ability to interpolate between observations.
