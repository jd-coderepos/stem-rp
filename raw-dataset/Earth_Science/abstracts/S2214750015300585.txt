There is scarcity of information on the possible mechanisms of pharmaceutical effluent induced genotoxicity and systemic toxicity. This study investigated the genotoxicity and systemic toxicity of a pharmaceutical effluent in Wistar rats. Rats were orally treated with 5â€“50% concentrations of the effluent for 28 days. At post-exposure, blood, liver, kidney and bone marrow cells were examined for alterations in serum biochemical parameters and hematological indices, histopathological lesions and micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes formation (MNPCE). The effluent caused concentration independent significant (p <0.05) alterations in aspartate (AST) and alanine (ALT) aminotransferases, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), total and direct bilirubin and creatinine. There was reduction in red blood count (RBC), hemoglobin concentration (HGB), platelets, percentage hematocrit (HCT), white blood count (WBC) and mean corpuscle hemoglobin (MCH) except mean corpuscle hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), which increased in the treated rats. Histopathological lesions observed in the liver and kidney of the effluent treated rats were thinning of the hepatic cord, kuffer cell hyperplasia, vacuolation of the hepatocytes and renal cells, multifocal inflammatory changes, necrosis and congestion of the renal blood vessels and central vein. MNPCE significantly increase in the bone marrow of the treated rats compared to the negative control. The concentration of some toxic metals and anions in the effluent were above standard permissible limits. These findings showed that the pharmaceutical effluent caused somatic DNA damage and systemic toxicity in rats may involve induction of oxidative stress, suggesting environmental contamination and health risks in wildlife and humans.
