This paper reports on recent improvements made to the FORMA (Hammer et al., 2014a) data product. The resulting system, FORMA250, is a 250-m alerting system updated daily. FORMA250 alerts are available through Global Forest Watch. These alerts can empower law enforcement officials, government agencies responsible for protecting forests, nongovernmental organizations, companies committed to sustainable forest management practices and supply chains, indigenous groups and forest-dependent communities. In addition, the alerts provide useful information for researchers who study temporal and spatial patterns of forest clearing.
