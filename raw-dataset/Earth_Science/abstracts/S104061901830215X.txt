The bulk power system is undergoing a digital revolution. With the recent and continuing growth of inverter-based generation, primarily wind and solar energy, the industry has begun exploring the implication of these new resources on power system reliability and resilience. This paper provides an overview and description of grid services that key resource types are able to provide, showing that new resources can provide many of the required grid reliability services.
