Statins (S) are widely used drugs for cardiovascular prevention however their utilization may cause a various grade of muscle toxicity. Sometime S discontinuation alone is not sufficient to revert muscle injury and this can evolve in serious inflammatory muscle disease. In this case immunosuppressive medications are required to achieve remission. This case report describes a patient who developed rhabdomyolysis after recent S treatment initiation and the diagnostic work up have lead to the diagnosis of necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (NAM). We believe that the clinical case described here is a useful report of this rare toxicity and we aim to highlight the importance of its prompt recognition and treatment.
