Diffuse agricultural pollution is widely recognized as a significant threat to the quality of water resources. Metaldehyde is a soluble synthetic aldehyde pesticide used globally in agriculture which has caused recent concern due to high observed levels (exceeding the European and UK standards for pesticides in drinking water value of 0.1 Âµg/l) in surface waters utilized for potable water supply. This paper describes the development of a new travel time based physically distributed metaldehyde prediction model which aims to describe the short term fluctuations of metaldehyde concentrations in surface waters caused by rainfall runoff events. This will enable water infrastructure operators to consider informed control decisions in order to improve the quality of abstracted surface water. The methodology is developed and trailed within a case study catchment in the UK. The new approach integrates spatially and temporally disaggregated surface runoff generation, routing and build-up/wash-off concepts using a simple structure in a GIS environment to build a metaldehyde concentration prediction model. The use of 1 km2 resolution radar rainfall data and identification of high risk areas in the catchment provide an approach which considers the spatio-temporal variations of pollutant generation and transport in the catchment. The model is calibrated and validated using available catchment flow and a new metaldehyde concentration dataset acquired using automatic samplers over four rainfall events. An average coefficient of determination and model efficiency of 0.75 and 0.46 respectively have been obtained for the rainfall events used to validate the model. This shows the capability of the model for the intended purpose of predicting the arrival of peak metaldehyde concentrations at surface water abstraction sites and informing abstraction decisions.
