We investigate the mechanical properties of the oceanic lithosphere using earthquake focal mechanisms from subduction zone outer rises. We study regions where faulting oblique to the pre-existing mid-ocean ridge fabric implies the formation of new faults. The nodal-plane dips of dip-slip earthquakes on these faults are dominantly in the range 30–60°, with a strong peak concentrated around 45°. This distribution is inconsistent with the pattern that would result from high coefficients of friction (e.g. 0.6, equivalent to normal faults forming at 60° and thrust faults at 30°). We instead suggest that the observed distribution of dips implies that faults in the oceanic lithosphere have a low coefficient of friction, due to either low-friction clay minerals formed by hydrothermal alteration at the ridge, or due to an intrinsic level of friction that is lower than that suggested by laboratory studies.
