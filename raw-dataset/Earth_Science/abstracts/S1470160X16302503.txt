The dike-pond system was a form of ecological engineering that was a component of successional dikes and ponds along the banks of the Pengxi River in the drawdown zone (DDZ) of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). The application of science-based evaluation system was appropriate for the flows of emergy in this agricultural ecosystem. The Emergy Analysis (EmA) has the ability to transform different types of inputs to a common form to allow meaningful comparisons across different systems. This study made use of the emergy analysis that assessed two different types of farming methods in the DDZ of the TGR. One method was planning crops in a dike-pond system (model I), and the other method was conventional agriculture (model II). In addition, the Exergies of both yields of agriculture methods were calculated, and the Exergy and Emergy Density (ED) were combined to explore the quality of these methods. The results showed that the two models relied on different resources. The ED yield of both models were similar, but the emergy investment of model II was greater than that of model I. Model II also used less renewable energy input to the agricultural systems than model I. The agricultural emergy sustainability index (AESI) of model I system (AESI=2.4>1) was greater than that of model II system (AESI=0.5<1), which indicated that the sustainable development of model I was stronger than that of model II in the DDZ of the TGR. The ratio Exergy/Emergy density (Rex/em ) in the two models of different agricultural system were 121.52×10−3 J/sej (Model I) and 24.19×10−3 J/sej (model II). Model I was greater than model II, and the result intimated that the model I agricultural system was a new method in the DDZ, but it was older and closer to the steady state than model II. The Emergy and Exergy analysis certifies that model I has a more acceptable and more sustainable development potential and is more stabilized in the DDZ of the TGR.
