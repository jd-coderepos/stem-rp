Context Metalloestrogens are small ionic metals that activate the estrogen receptor (ER). Studies have shown that when metalloestrogens bind to the ER, there is an increase in transcription and expression of estrogen-regulated genes, which induces proliferation of estrogen-dependent breast cancer. Methylmercury (MeHg), a metalloestrogen, is present in the environment and is toxic at moderate to high concentrations. However, at lower concentrations MeHg may promote the proliferation of ER-positive breast cancers and protect cells against pro-apoptotic signals. Objective To investigate the effects of MeHg treatment on breast cancer cells in vitro. Materials and methods MCF7 breast cancer cells were treated with concentrations of MeHg ranging from 1 nM to 100 mM. Hg analysis was used to quantify intracellular mercury concentrations. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined by cell counting and Annexin-V staining, respectively. Results We defined a protocol that maximizes cellular exposure to mercury. Treatment of human ER-positive breast cancer cells with 1 nM MeHg promoted proliferation, while treatment with a concentration of 100 nM induced apoptosis. Discussion and conclusions Clarifying the effects of MeHg on breast cancer will improve our understanding of how environmental toxins affect tumor progression and may lead to the development of future therapeutic strategies.
