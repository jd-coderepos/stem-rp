This study presents a qualitative, comparative analysis of ex ante visualizations, created during planning and design phases, with ex post photography of landscape and architectural projects. Visualizations play an increasingly important role as decision-making tools in the planning process and are expected to successfully communicate proposals to both experts and laypersons. Outside of the wind farm industry there is a lack of detailed guidance for those creating landscape visualizations and currently no method of analyzing the accuracy of visualizations exists. In a world where we increasingly rely on information communicated in a visual manner it is imperative that potential viewers are provided with clues to enable them to distinguish between what is real and what is not. This study analyses a selection of visualizations from a cross section of landscape and architectural projects and reveals reoccurring patterns of inconsistencies in the depiction of content elements. The control of production through agreed guidelines proposed by previously published research could have both positive and negative effects for the future of visualization production. This research proposes that the starting point for honest communication lies in transparency, in both production techniques and presentation to clients, stakeholders and the public. There is scope for more in depth image analysis of a larger body of projects that may reveal more detailed findings that could contribute to future guideline discussions.
