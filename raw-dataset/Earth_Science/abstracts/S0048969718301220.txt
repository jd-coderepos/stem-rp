Triclosan (TCS) is an antibacterial chemical widely used in personal-care products and an endocrine disruptor. While TCS exposure is associated with insulin resistance and metabolic disorders in animals, few studies have assessed its effect on the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in humans. This study aimed to explore whether maternal urinary TCS level is associated with the risk of GDM and infant birthweight. We examined 620 pregnant women from Shanghai, China in 2012–2013. Urinary TCS level was measured with high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS), and categorized into high, medium and low in tertiles. GDM was defined based on recommendation of International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG). The GDM rate was 12.7%. TCS was detectable (≥0.1 ng/mL) in 97.9% women (median 2.7 ng/mL). There was a positive, but statistically non-significant association between urinary TCS levels and GDM (adjusted odds ratio 1.17; 95%CI: 0.99, 1.39, with each unit increase of log (TCS) ng/mL) with adjustment for urinary creatinine, maternal age, education, passive smoking, parity and prepregnancy BMI categories. 48.1% of infants were females. Birthweight was 122.8 g higher (95% CI: 13.9, 231.6 g) for female infants of women in high TCS (median 13.3 ng/mL) versus low TCS (median 0.77 ng/mL), with adjustment for urinary creatinine, prepregnancy BMI, GDM and other confounders. No association was found between maternal TCS and birthweight in male infants. These results suggested the potential for TCS to be associated with increased risk of GDM and a gender-specific association with higher birthweight among female infants in a population with widespread but moderate exposure to TCS.
