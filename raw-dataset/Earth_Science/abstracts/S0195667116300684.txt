A river section at Słupia Nadbrzeżna, central Poland, has been proposed as a candidate Turonian – Coniacian (Cretaceous) GSSP, in combination with the Salzgitter-Salder quarry section of Lower Saxony, Germany. Results of a high-resolution (25 cm) palynological study of the boundary interval in the Słupia Nadbrzeżna section are presented. Terrestrial palynomorphs are rare; marine organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts dominate the palynological assemblage. The dinoflagellate cyst assemblage has a low species richness (5–11 per sample; total of 18 species recorded) and diversity (Shannon index H = 0.8–1.4), dominated by four taxa: Circulodinium distinctum subsp. distinctum; Oligosphaeridium complex; Spiniferites ramosus subsp. ramosus; Surculosphaeridium longifurcatum. Declining proportions of O. complex and S. ramosus subsp. ramosus characterise the uppermost Turonian, with an increased dominance of S. longifurcatum in the lower Coniacian. The Turonian – Coniacian boundary interval includes an acme of C. distinctum subsp. distinctum in the upper Mytiloides scupini Zone, a dinoflagellate cyst abundance maximum in the Cremnoceramus walterdorfensis walterdorfensis Zone, and the highest occurrence of Senoniasphaera turonica in the basal Coniacian lower Cremnoceramus deformis erectus Zone. Most previously reported Turonian – Coniacian boundary dinoflagellate cyst marker species are absent; a shallow-water oligotrophic epicontinental depositional setting, remote from terrestrial influence, likely limited species diversity and excluded many taxa of biostratigraphic value.
