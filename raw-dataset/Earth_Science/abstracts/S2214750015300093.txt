Cadmium (Cd) is a known hepato- and nephrotoxic pollutant and zinc (Zn) metalloproteins are important targets of Cd. Hence, the administration of Zn may mitigate Cd toxic effects. However, the interaction of Cd and Zn has been little investigated in the brain. Previously, we reported a protective effect of Zn on mortality caused by Cd in rats. Here, we tested whether the protective effect of Zn could be related to changes in brain Zn-proteins, metallothionein (MT) and δ-aminolevulinate dehydratse (δ-ALA-D). Male adult rats were daily administered for 10 days with Zn (2mgkg−1), Cd (0.25 and 1mgkg−1) and 0.25mgkg−1 of Cd plus Zn and 1mgkg−1 of Cd plus Zn. The body weight loss, food intake deprivation, and mortality occurred in 1mgkg−1 of Cd, but Zn co-administration did mitigate these effects. The brain Zn content was not modified by treatment with Cd, whereas cerebral Cd levels increased in animals exposed to Cd. The administration of 0.25mgkg−1 of Cd (with or without Zn) induced lipid peroxidation and decreased MT concentration, but 2mgkg−1 of Zn and 1mgkg−1 of Cd did not change these parameters. Brain δ-ALA-D was not modified by Cd and/or Zn treatments. Since the co-administration of Zn did not attenuate the changes induced by Cd in the brain, our results suggest that the protective effect of Zn on impairments caused by Cd in animal status is weakly related to a cerebral interaction of these metals.
