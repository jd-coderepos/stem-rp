The signatures in force and response time series from ice-ridge interactions on vertically sided structures are not described in standards and are among the least understood types of ice-structure interactions. In this paper, we identified 35 high global-force ridge events at the Norstr√∂msgrund lighthouse in the winters of 1999/2000 to 2002/2003. During these events, load panels rendered global forces in excess of 3 MN, where the highest global force measured was approximately 6 MN. The type of ice-ridge interaction mode was further classified based on the signatures in force and the response time series as well as video records. The classified ice-ridge interactions included 1) limit-force stalling, 2) limit-stress ductile failure and 3) limit-stress brittle failure. Based on the suggested format of classification, recommendations for future instrumentation are proposed.
