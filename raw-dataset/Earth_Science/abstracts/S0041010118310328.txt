Purpose We previously reported the efficacy of intraarticular (IA) rimabotulinumtoxinB (BoNT/B) in a murine model of chronic degenerative arthritis pain. This study aimed to measure the analgesic effects of onabotulinumtoxinA (BoNT/A) on collagenase induced chronic degenerative arthritis joint pain. Methods Chronic degenerative arthritis was produced by IA injection of 10 μl collagenase (Col) (10 IU) into the left knee of C57BL/6J female mice 4 weeks prior to pain assessment. IA BoNT/A was injected 3 days before testing. Arthritis pain was measured as evoked pain scores (EPS) and spontaneous pain behaviors with an advanced dynamic weight bearing (ADWB) device. EPS was a tally of fights and vocalizations exhibited in one minute with knee palpation. Percent body weight and percent time spent on each limb was quantified. All mice were 12 weeks old at the time of examination. Results IA Col increased EPS and reduced ADWB measures of percent weight bearing on the left hind limb compared to naïve mice. BoNT/A treatment reduced EPS and increased weight bearing on the left hind limb. The improvements were not significant compared to the Col group. There was no significant difference in time spent on the left hind limb between any treatment groups. Forelimb ADWB measures of percent weight and time in arthritic mice significantly increased compared to nonarthritic animals. Treatment with BoNT/A in the arthritic limb decreased this offloading; however, statistical analysis only showed significance in weightbearing. Conclusion IA Col monoarthritis increased evoked and spontaneous pain behaviors in female mice after four weeks. Treatment with IA BoNT/A decreased pain behaviors but only forelimb weight bearing showed a significant improvement. This led us to conclude that treatment with BoNT/A is not an effective analgesic for the treatment of chronic degenerative knee arthritis in murine models.
