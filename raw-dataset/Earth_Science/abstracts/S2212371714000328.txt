In our work, we tried to determine the asset value of water from natural resources. During the research we decided that a method based on allowance capitalization can be the most effective. Thus, the developed method is able to estimate water property value in a nationally uniformed system by utilizing final products. It has been decided that the determined method of Water Allowance Coefficient (WAC) is based on water footprint results of domestic wheat production. Water footprint was chosen because it is able to refer to water availability by also considering both direct and indirect usage of water. It covers absolute volume of our freshwater needs, which also can be determined as the availability potential of freshwater resources. Methodological statement, because changes in AWVs (Adjusted Water Value) vary among regions, the distances of regional values would disappear by ranking. To eliminate this, the WAC values were directly used.
