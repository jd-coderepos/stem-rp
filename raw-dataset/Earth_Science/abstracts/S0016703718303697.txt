Cobalt is a waste product in many industrial processes and its most common radioactive isotope – 60Co – is a by-product of nuclear reactors. To better understand the mobility and fate of Co in natural and contaminated environments we investigated Co sorption behaviour to the common soil and sediment constituents ferrihydrite, kaolinite, humic acid (HA), and ferrihydrite-HA and kaolinite-HA organo-mineral composites using sorption batch experiments, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). We measured the sorption of Co to the end-member mineral and organic phases and the composites as a function of pH, ionic strength and Co concentration, and also for the composites as a function of organic carbon concentration, with composites made containing a wide range of organic carbon contents. We then determined the molecular mechanisms of Co sorption to the end-member phases and the composites, and used this information to develop molecularly constrained thermodynamic surface complexation models to quantify Co sorption. Sorption to the ferrihydrite-HA and kaolinite-HA organo-mineral composites was found to be intermediate to both of the end-member phases, displaying enhanced sorption respective to the mineral end-member phase at mid-low pH. EXAFS analysis shows that there is a universal sorption mechanism accounting for Co sorption to the end-member mineral and organic phases and the organo-mineral composites at mid-high pH, in which Co sorbs to these phases via inner-sphere bidentate binuclear surface complexes. At mid-low pH, sorption to all the phases except ferrihydrite is the result of outer-sphere complexation. Our new molecularly constrained thermodynamic surface complexation models for Co sorption to ferrihydrite, kaolinite, HA, and ferrihydrite-HA and kaolinite-HA organo-mineral composites, show that Co sorption to the composites cannot be modelled assuming linear additivity of Co sorption to the end-member phases.
