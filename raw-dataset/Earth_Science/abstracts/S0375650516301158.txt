This study finds that the geothermal doublet layout with respect to the paleo flow direction in fluvial sedimentary reservoirs could significantly affect pump energy losses. These losses can be reduced by up to 10% if a doublet well pair is oriented parallel to the paleo flow trend compared to perpendicular. The chance that flow paths are formed perpendicular to this trend strongly depends on the net sandstone volume in the reservoir. Detailed fluvial facies architecture realisations which are used in this study, are generated with a process-based approach utilizing geological data from the Lower Cretaceous Nieuwerkerk Formation in the West Netherlands Basin. Finally, this study emphasizes the importance of detailed facies architecture modelling for the assessment of both risks and production strategies in Hot Sedimentary Aquifers.
