The development of a dual-wavelength full-waveform terrestrial laser scanner to measure the three-dimensional structure of forest canopies is described, and field measurements used to evaluate and test the instrument measurement characteristics. The Salford Advanced Laser Canopy Analyser (SALCA) measures the full-waveform of backscattered radiation at two laser wavelengths, one in the near-infrared (1063nm) and one in the shortwave infrared (1545nm). The instrument is field-portable and measures up to nine million waveforms, at the two wavelengths, across a complete hemisphere above the instrument. SALCA was purpose-built to measure structural characteristics of forest canopies and this paper reports the first results of field-based data collection using the instrument. Characteristics of the waveforms, and waveform data processing are outlined, applications of dual wavelength measurements are evaluated, and field deployment of the instrument at a forest test site described. Preliminary instrument calibration results are presented and challenges in extracting useful information on forest structure are highlighted. Full-waveform multiple-wavelength terrestrial laser scanners are likely to provide more detailed and more accurate forest structural measurement in the future. This research demonstrates how SALCA provides a key step to develop, test and apply this new technology in a range of forest-related problems.
