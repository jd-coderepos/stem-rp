That urban green space can provide opportunities for psychological restoration which could prove valuable in promoting public health now seems relatively well established. What is less clear is whether many of us will continue to avail ourselves of these opportunities. Perhaps the question to pose is less one of whether green space experience can be good for people and more one of how best to tempt them there. This essay draws on a serial interview study with a sample of city professionals who ventured relatively infrequently into the various parks and gardens scattered around their offices. The aim is to stage a broader discussion about ways of researching those who seem happy to go without green space experience and the role of qualitative methods in questioning the most effective means of engaging with them.
