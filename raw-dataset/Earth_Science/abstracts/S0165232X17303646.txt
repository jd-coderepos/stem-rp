A simple scaling analysis using a simple mass block model supports observations and measurements on snow avalanches, that the maximum front-velocity of “major” avalanches scales with the total drop height of the track. That is U m a x ∼ g H s c / 2 and the average velocity U ¯ ≈ 2 π U max . The approximation of avalanche tracks as either cycloid or parabola reveal furthermore the connection between the path geometry and the well-known α-β model (Lied and Bakkehøi, 1980). This connection implies a strong dependency of the apparent retardation on the mean steepness of the track. The velocity scaling and the dependency of the retardation on the mean slope angle needs to be reflected in avalanche models.
