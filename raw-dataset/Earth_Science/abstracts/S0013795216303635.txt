The evolution of natural slopes over time is ruled by several concurrent physical phenomena, namely the strength of its component geomaterials and their weakening over time due to weathering processes, the occurrence of seismic events, seepage and the formation of tension cracks. The paper presents analytical solutions obtained considering a succession of discrete failure events (landslides) progressively altering the slope morphology over time. The model, derived in the framework of limit analysis assuming plane strain conditions, provides a tool for the assessment of whether manufacts and/or infrastructures located on a slope subject to various natural degradation phenomena will be affected by the occurrence of failures. Unlike current empirical and semi-empirical models of slope evolution, the analytical solution that is here presented is derived by applying principles of soil and rock mechanics, therefore it is of general validity, so that no ad–hoc calibration against past observations of the evolving slope is needed. This analytical technique only requires knowledge of the (geotechnical) parameters characterising the geomaterials comprising the slope of interest, namely angle of shearing resistance, ϕ, cohesion, c, tensile strength, unit weight, together with knowledge of the relevant seepage scenarios, strength degradation processes, and seismic events likely to occur. Results show that that earthquake loading and seepage can substantially decrease slope stability, increase the volume of material sliding away during each landslide event and alter the evolution of the slope over time, while tensile strength exhibits a less strong influence especially as strength degradation progresses.
