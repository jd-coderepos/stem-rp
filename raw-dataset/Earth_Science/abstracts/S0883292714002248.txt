Surface soils from a 19km2 area in east London, UK were analysed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) (n =76). ∑16 PAH ranged from 4 to 67mg/kg (mean, 18mg/kg) and ∑50 PAH ranged from 6 to 88mg/kg (mean, 25mg/kg). ∑7 PCB ranged from 1 to 750μg/kg (mean, 22μg/kg) and ∑tri-hepta PCB ranged 9 to 2600μg/kg (mean, 120μg/kg). Compared to other international cities concentrations were similar for PAH but higher for PCB. Normal background concentrations (NBC) were calculated and compared to risk-based human health generic assessment criteria (GAC). Benzo[a]pyrene NBC for urban (6.9mg/kg), semi-urban (4.4mg/kg) and urban+semi urban (6mg/kg) domains exceed residential (1mg/kg) and allotment (2.2mg/kg) LQM/CIEH GAC (at 6% SOM) and the Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene NBC for urban (6.8mg/kg) and urban+semi-urban (5.2mg/kg) domains exceed the residential (4.2mg/kg) LQM/CIEH GAC (at 6% SOM). Capsule Abstract: Normal background concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls are elevated in east London soils and in some cases exceed regulatory assessment criteria.
