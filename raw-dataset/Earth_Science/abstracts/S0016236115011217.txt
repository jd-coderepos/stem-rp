The puffing and micro-explosion of a single burning droplet comprised of neat diesel, rapeseed methyl ester (RME); binary fuel mixtures of diesel–ethanol, diesel–RME, RME–ethanol; and ternary microemulsion of these fuel blends at various compositions have been studied using high speed backlight imaging method. Fuel droplet was suspended on the tip of a 130μm gauge thermocouple and it was ignited using a glow plug heater. Based on the temporal variation of droplet projected area, the characteristics of fuel droplets studied were classified into smooth burning, puffing and explosion. A ternary plot has been proposed to identify the mixture composition of the blends that can result in smooth burning, puffing and explosion. Micro-explosion phenomenon was observed in the ternary blends with ethanol percentages between 10% and 40%. Secondary droplets resulted from the puffing and explosion of suspended parent droplet were observed to undergo further explosion. The time scales associated with complete disintegration of secondary droplets are found to be comparable to the mixing and the chemical reaction time scales of sprays in diesel engines.
