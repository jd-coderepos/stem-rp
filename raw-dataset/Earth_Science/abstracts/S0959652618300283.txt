The need to use Building Information Modelling (BIM) for Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW) minimisation is well documented but most of the existing CDW management tools still lack BIM functionality. This study therefore assesses the expectations of stakeholders on how BIM could be employed for CDW management. After a review of extant literature to assess the limitations of existing CDW management tools, qualitative Focus Group Interviews (FGIs) were conducted with professionals who are familiar with the use of BIM to understand their expectations on the use of BIM for CDW management. The 22 factors identified from the qualitative data analyses were then developed into a questionnaire survey. The exploratory factor analysis of the responses reveals five major groups of BIM expectations for CDW management, which are: (i) BIM-based collaboration for waste management, (ii) waste-driven design process and solutions, (iii) waste analysis throughout building lifecycle, (iv) innovative technologies for waste intelligence and analytics, and (v) improved documentation for waste management. Considering these groups of factors is key to meeting the needs of the stakeholders regarding the use of BIM for CDW management. These groups of factors are important considerations for the implementation and acceptance of BIM-based tools and practices for CDW management within the construction industry.
