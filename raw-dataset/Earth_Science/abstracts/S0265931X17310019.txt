Using a recently published global data set of 22Na and 7Be from the global monitoring network of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), atmospheric circulation and stratosphere-troposphere interactions are examined. Cosmogenic 22Na has a half-life well-suited to environmental processes with durations from several months to a decade. Combined with corresponding 7Be observations, these two cosmogenic isotopes form a useful environmental tracer and new radiochronometer to study physical interactions of air masses in the stratosphere and troposphere.
