Demersal fish were assessed by remotely operated vehicle (ROV) video transects at sites to the NE, NW (54째N), SE and SW (49째N) of the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone (CGFZ) at ca. 2500m depth on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. At each site, three different slope categories (flat, 10째 slope and >30째 slope) were sampled with four transects, each surveying 2000m3 of suprabenthic water. This resulted in 12 high-definition video transects at every site, covering a total of 24,000m3 suprabenthic water. Six species were observed; which was fewer than in surveys using baited landers (19 species) and trawls (26 species) in the same area. Bathysaurus ferox, Halosauropsis macrochir, Antimora rostrata and Polyacanthonotus challengeri did not vary in density between sites, while Coryphaenoides brevibarbis and Coryphaenoides armatus were significantly more abundant at the northern sites; the latter supporting findings using baited landers. The halosaur H. macrochir was the only species affected by slope. The majority of observed fish showed no reaction to one or more of the stimuli produced by the ROV, however burst swimming was observed at least once in all species except B. ferox. The most abundant species, C. brevibarbis, was particularly affected by the presence of the ROV.
