In-situ kinetics and mechanisms of Ni2+ uptake by synthetic vernadite were determined at pH5.8 and I =0.1M NaCl using wet chemistry, atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) and synchrotron high-energy X-ray scattering (HEXS) in both the Bragg-rod and pair distribution function formalisms. The structural formula of the initial solids was TCMn3+ 0.05Na+ 0.23(H2O)0.69H+ 0.06[(Mn4+ 0.86Mn3+ 0.04vac0.1)O2], where species under brackets form the layer having “vac” layer vacancies, and where other species are present in the interlayer, with TC standing for “triple-corner sharing” configuration. According to HEXS and STEM-EELS, adsorbed Ni2+ adopted mainly a TC configuration, and had a Debye-Waller factor about four times higher than layer Mn. Steady-state was reached after ~2.2h of contact time, and the final structural formula of the solid was TCNi2+ 0.12 TCMn3+ 0.05Na+ 0.12H2O0.36H+ 0.01[(Mn4+ 0.87vac0.13)O2]. Atomic-scale imaging of the solids also evinced the presence of minor Ni adsorbed at the crystal edge. The retention coefficient RD =103.76±0.06 Lkg−1, computed from PDF data modelling and solution chemistry results, was in agreement with those available in the literature.
