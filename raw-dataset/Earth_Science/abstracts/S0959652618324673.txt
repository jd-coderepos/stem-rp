A study of a local industrial symbiosis involving the recovery of platinum from waste thermocouples which is then used for the preparation of catalytic electrodes suitable for dye-sensitized solar cell production is reported. The small quantity of platinum in the filaments of used thermocouples, thousands of which are discarded each year by metal foundries, can be economically recovered by conversion to chloroplatinic acid hydrate, an ‘added value’ product, which can then be used in the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cell counter-electrodes. 91% recovery of platinum from filaments as chloroplatinic acid hydrate has been achieved by aqua regia digestion of manually isolated filaments. Cost-benefit analysis shows the proposed process derives sufficient value to cover landfill costs for what is left of the waste thermocouples after platinum removal; provide ∼5 days employment; and provide 63% materials cost savings for electrode preparation in comparison to purchasing commercially available chloroplatinic acid hydrate. The proposed local industrial symbiosis would, per year, divert ∼50 g of platinum from landfill, avoid up to 1400 kg of CO2 emissions associated with primary production of an equivalent quantity of platinum, and give enough platinum to produce catalytic electrodes for ∼500 m2 of dye-sensitized solar cells, which could supply clean energy for 12 homes in the locality. The process exemplifies the environmental, economic and social benefits available through adoption of circular practices, which make use of secondary materials available within the local economy by valorizing wastes. The process also overcomes economic barriers to critical raw materials (CRMs) recovery from dissipative applications.
