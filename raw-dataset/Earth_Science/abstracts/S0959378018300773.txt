Small-scale fisheries are an important source of livelihoods, particularly among poor coastal populations. To improve fisheries’ condition and maximize their contribution to human welfare, co-management approaches have proliferated worldwide. In this article, we conduct a systematic review of academic literature to examine the context and attributes of co-management initiatives in small-scale fisheries, and their expected outcomes. The review suggests that a supporting legal and institutional framework facilitates the emergence of co-management, because it contributes to clarify and legitimize property rights over fish resources. It is also found that co-management delivers both ecological and social benefits: it increases the abundance and habitat of species, fish catches, actors’ participation, and the fishery’s adaptive capacity, as well as it induces processes of social learning. Furthermore, co-management is more effective if artisanal fishers and diverse stakeholders become involved through an adaptive institutional framework. However, the review also suggests that more research is needed to discern when co-management initiatives can transform pre-existing conflicts, challenge power asymmetries and distribute benefits more equitably.
