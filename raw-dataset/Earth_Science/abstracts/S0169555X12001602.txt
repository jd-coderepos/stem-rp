We describe the use of a fully volumetric geophysical imaging approach, three-dimensional electrical resistivity (3D ERT), for bedrock detection below mixed sand and gravel deposits typical of fluvial valley-fill terraces. We illustrate the method through an analysis of terrace deposits of the Great Ouse River (UK), where up to 4m of sand and gravel have filled the valley bottom during the latest Pleistocene. We use an edge detector to identify the steepest gradient in first-derivative resistivity profiles, which yields an estimate of bedrock depth (verified by drilling) to a precision better than 0.2m (average) and 0.4m (standard deviation). Comparison of a range of drilling techniques at the site has revealed that borehole derived interface depths suffered from levels of uncertainty similar to those associated with the 3D ERT â€” indicating that the reliability of bedrock interface depths determined using these two approaches is comparable in this case. The 3D ERT method provides a high spatial resolution that enabled a previously unknown erosional bedrock structure, associated with the change from deeper first terrace to second terrace deposits, to be identified in the Great Ouse valley. The method provides a relatively quick method to quantify terrace fill volume over large sites to a greater degree of precision than currently available.
