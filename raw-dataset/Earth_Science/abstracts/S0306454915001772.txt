This paper investigates the duration of the Partitioning and Transmutation process for different efficiencies in the total mass reduction of high-level waste by describing the mass flow during the process. Besides the transmutation and partitioning efficiency per fuel cycle, the impact of the deployed thermal power and the refreshing time, which is the sum of cooling, reprocessing, and fabrication time, was analyzed. It was discovered that besides the transmutation efficiency the refreshing time has a significant impact on the duration. The molten salt reactor concept is proposed in order to realize this potential for shortening the time consuming P&T process.
