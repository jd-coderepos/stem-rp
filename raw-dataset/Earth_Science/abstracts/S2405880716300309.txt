Currently, the analysis of heat waves and the representation of such events in a comprehensible and accessible way is a crucial challenge for climate services, in particular for delivering scientific support to policy makers. In order to fulfil this need, a new method for analysing the heat waves in France has been defined. Heat wave detection is based on the high quantiles of daily temperature distributions, and can be applied on any series of temperature. The heat waves are characterised by their duration, maximal temperature and global intensity. Their characteristics are calculated for historical and future climate based on the EURO-CORDEX regional multi-model ensemble, under two different Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The historical simulations are evaluated against the SAFRAN reanalysis data. The EURO-CORDEX ensemble simulates heat waves which characteristics are consistent with the events detected from the SAFRAN thermal indicator between 1971 and 2005. Models are able to simulate waves as intense as the 2003 outstanding event. Under future climate conditions, whatever the considered scenario, the heat waves become more frequent and have higher mean duration and intensity. Moreover, heat waves could occur during a larger part of summer. The 2003 event corresponds to a typical event at the end of the century, and its duration and intensity are much lower than the strongest waves that could occur over the last 30years of the 21st century. However, the intensity of the evolution during the end of the century will strongly depend on climate policies.
