Twenty-six common ingredients of personal care products (PCPs) in water, sediment and fish from the Evrotas River (Greece) were investigated. Water sample analysis revealed the occurrence of twenty PCPs at concentrations ranging from 2.8 to 2031.0 ng l−1, the maximum corresponding to the endocrine disrupting UV filter benzophenone 3 (BP3). In sediment samples, six compounds were found to be adsorbed, the highest concentration being that of 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4MBC, 1400.4 ng g−1 dw). Evrotas cyprinid fish (Squalius keadicus) showed a high accumulation potential for these chemicals, 100% detection frequency with maximum concentration that of benzophenone 2 (BP2, 41.9 ng g−1 dw). These data allowed estimating the distribution coefficients sediment-water (DCs-w) and the bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of the pollutants investigated. Calculated rates revealed that benzophenone 1 (BP1), 4-hydroxybenzophenone (4HB) and ethyl-4-(dimethyl-amino)benzoate (EtPABA) have a strong tendency to adsorb onto the sediments, showing high DCs-w, i.e. 8.2E + 4 l g−1, 6.7E + 4 l g−1 and 5.7E + 3 l g−1, respectively. BFAs were only estimated for 5-methyl benzotriazole (MeBT), the compound having paired data from fish and water. The obtained values (range 2.0E + 2 l g−1–3.8E + 3 l g−1), indicated MeBT's strong bioaccumulation. Risk assessment of the investigated compounds for several aquatic organisms indicated a high ecological risk (HQ > 1) for BP3 and medium ecological risk (HQ ~ 0.5) for ODPABA.
