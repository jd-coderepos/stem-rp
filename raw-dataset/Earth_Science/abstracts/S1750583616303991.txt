This paper presents the first empirical data of soil temperature and soil moisture profiles with depth in the context of a buried Carbon Capture and Storage transportation pipeline operating at higher than ambient soil temperatures. In an experimental approach, soil temperature responses are non-linear and are raised and restricted to within 45cm of the subsurface heat source (hypothetical pipeline). A surface heat source is included to investigate interactions of natural seasonal surface heating of soils with subsurface heat. There is no interaction between subsurface and surface heat sources in the experimental system. Soil moisture profiles vary with soil type, with overall soil moisture losses of >10% over experimental time courses. Modelled soil temperature profiles show that the ability of soils to buffer thermal movement from depths up to 1.2m from the surface is currently inadequately represented. Measurements provide the first elementary data of soil temperature changes resulting from a subsurface heat source for more accurate modelling of soil/pipeline interactions.
