The Baltic Sea is an enclosed basin that experienced a number of different salinity phases during the Holocene corresponding to the establishment of a connection with the North Sea. Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in surface sediments and Holocene sedimentary successions from the Gotland and Arkona Basins were analyzed to examine their potential applicability as indicators for soil organic matter input, as well as their suitability for paleoclimate reconstructions. Our results show a marked change in brGDGT distributions and the branched and isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index. The transition of the Ancylus Lake (fresh) to the Littorina Sea (brackish) phase is revealed by a large drop in the BIT index and an increase in the MBTâ€²5Me, which reveals a large shift in provenance of the sedimentary brGDGTs. During the lake phase, brGDGTs are presumed to be primarily produced by in situ production in the water column. During the brackish phase, in situ brGDGT production in the alkaline pore waters of the surface sediments (as revealed by their high degree of cyclization) was predominant although there was evidence of occasional input of soil-derived brGDGTs. The predominant aquatic autochthonous production of brGDGTs does not allow the use of brGDGTs for continental air temperature reconstructions but they can be used for bottom water and lake temperature reconstructions during some intervals. The results from this study demonstrate that geological changes and concomittant salinity variations can be revealed by the provenance of brGDGTs.
