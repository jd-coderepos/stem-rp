The European Commission's Joint Research Centre organizes proficiency tests (PT) on radon-in-water measurements. In order to optimize sampling, transport and measurement methods many tests and small scale proficiency tests have been performed. The waters from natural springs, wells were sampled on-site in glass bottles then transported cooled to the JRC and collaborating laboratories. For the material characterization standard measurement methods based on gamma-ray spectrometry, emanometry and liquid scintillation counting were used. The influence of sampling, transport and sample handling on radon-loss was tested and quantified. It was observed that parameters like container material, filling height, storage temperature and handling can lead to substantial measurement bias due to radon-loss. This high risk for radon-loss from samples can potentially be a general radioprotection problem as doses to the public may be underestimated. Regular air and road transport can be considered adequate means of transport as they have little influence on radon-loss if a suitable glass sample container with flexible cap is used and that it is completely filled. On the basis of this work, modifications to the related standard as best practices are also proposed.
