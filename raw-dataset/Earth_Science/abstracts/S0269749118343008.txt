The wide adoption of combined heat and power (CHP) can not only improve energy efficiency, but also strengthens energy system resiliency. While CHP reduces overall emissions compared to generating the same amount of electricity and heat separately, its on-site nature also means that CHP facilities operate in populated areas, raising concerns over their near-source air quality impact. Evaluation of the near-source impact of distributed CHP is limited by emission data availability, especially in terms of particulate matter (PM). In this paper, we report on stack emission testing results of a community-scale CHP plant with two natural gas turbine units (15 MW each) from measurements conducted in both 2010 and 2015, and assess the near-source air quality impact using an integrated modeling framework using the stack test results, site-specific meteorological data and terrain profiles with buildings. The NOx removal efficiency by selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is estimated to be ∼83% according to the emission testing. The integrated framework employs AERMOD to screen air quality in a 2.7 km × 2.3 km domain from 2011 to 2015 to identify the highest ground-level concentrations (GLCs). Examining the corresponding meteorological conditions, we find that those high GLCs appeared during the stable atmospheric boundary layer with relative high wind speed. Next, the worse-case scenarios identified from the screening process are simulated using the detailed Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) model coupled with a chemistry solver. The results generally show low GLCs of primary PM2.5 for this case study. However, our analysis also suggests greater building downwash impacts with the presence of taller and denser urban structures. Therefore, the near-source impact of natural gas-fired CHP in large metropolitan areas is worthy of further investigation.
