The effects of petroleum aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on the embryonic and larval life stages of teleosts have been extensively examined. However, very little work has been conducted on how spilled oil affects fish sperm and there is no related knowledge concerning oil dispersing agents. The objective of our study was to determine sperm performance of a teleost fish under direct exposure to different concentrations of WAF (water accommodated fraction) and CEWAF (chemically enhanced water accommodated fraction). Capelin sperm motility, swimming behaviour, and sperm fertilization ability were evaluated in a scenario of an oil spill untreated (WAF) and treated (CEWAF) with the dispersant Corexit® EC9500A. Sperm fertilizing ability was lower when exposed to CEWAF concentrations of 16.1 × 103 μg/L total petroleum hydrocarbons and 47.9 μg/L PAH, and when exposed to the dispersant alone. The mechanism responsible for this reduced fertilizing ability is not clear. However, it is not related to the percentage of motile sperm or sperm swimming behaviour, as these were unaffected. WAF did not alter sperm swimming characteristics nor the fertilizing ability. We suggest the dispersant rather than the dispersed oil is responsible for the decrease in the sperm fertilizing ability and hypothesize that the surfactants present in the dispersant affect sperm membrane functionality.
