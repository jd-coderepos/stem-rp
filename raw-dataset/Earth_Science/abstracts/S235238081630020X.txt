The influence of surface boundary conditions, varying climatic conditions and engineering material parameters on the collection performance of near surface interseasonal ground energy collection and storage systems are investigated. In particular, the performance of a proposed design of an interseasonal heat storage system which has also been investigated by others as part of a full scale demonstration project is considered. A numerical model is developed and validated against field data. It is then applied to undertake a series of simulations with varying system parameters. It is found that (i) higher values of thermal conductivity of the storage layer result in increased storage of thermal energy and lower peak temperatures, (ii) system heat losses are strongly influenced by the performance of insulation layers, (iii) warmer climatic conditions provide more thermal energy available to be stored; however, changes in the amplitude of seasonal air temperature variations have an effect on the rate of collection of thermal energy and (iv) the use of correct surface boundary conditions is critical in modelling the dynamics of these systems.
