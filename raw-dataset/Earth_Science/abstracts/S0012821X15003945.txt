The geological record documents links between glacial cycles and volcanic productivity, both subaerially and, tentatively, at mid-ocean ridges. Sea-level-driven pressure changes could also affect chemical properties of mid-ocean ridge volcanism. We consider how changing sea-level could alter the CO2 emissions rate from mid-ocean ridges on both the segment and global scale. We develop a simplified transport model for a highly incompatible trace element moving through a homogeneous mantle; variations in the concentration and the emission rate of the element are the result of changes in the depth of first silicate melting. The model predicts an average global mid-ocean ridge CO2 emissions rate of 53 Mt/yr or 91 Mt/yr for an average source mantle CO2 concentration of 125 or 215 ppm by weight, in line with other estimates. We show that falling sea level would cause an increase in ridge CO2 emissions about 100 kyrs after the causative sea level change. The lag and amplitude of the response are sensitive to mantle permeability and plate spreading rate. For a reconstructed sea-level time series of the past million years, we predict variations of up to 12 % in global mid-ocean ridge CO2 emissions.
