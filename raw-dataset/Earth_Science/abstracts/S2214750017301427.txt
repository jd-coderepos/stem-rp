Nigeria, being a tropical nation, characterized by favorable climatic conditions, may display high chances of feed contaminations due to aflatoxigenic Aspergillus flavus with the consequences of health risks associated with the consumption of dairy products. A cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the risks of occurrence and distribution of aflatoxigenic Aspergillus flavus (A. flavus) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) contamination levels based on the European Union (EU) and United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) set limits. Feeds (n = 144) were collected from selected conventional and traditional dairy herds; prepared and analyzed using immuno-affinity column (IAC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) respectively. Forty eight (55.8%) isolates were identified as A. flavus of the isolated Aspergilli (n = 86). Of this proportion, 12 (25.0%) were aflatoxigenic strains. An outrageous number of the tested feeds (86.8%, n = 144) were positive for AFB1 contamination. Detectable AFB1 concentrations ranged between (0.5 and 24.8) μgKg−1 and were distributed variously according to many factors of distribution. Eighty three (66.4%, n = 125) of the AFB1 contaminated feed samples showed AFB1 concentrations between 5 and ≥20 μgKg-1. All-inclusive policies are key to reducing the health risks posed to the consumers of dairy products.
