The Tananao Schist Belt is a low-pressure metamorphic complex comprised of three lithological units of marble, schist formation, and granite, in ascending order of proportion. Previous studies have found that the schist formation was formed during the Mesozoic. However, there is a lack of geochronological data to corroborate the schist protolith and metamorphic ages. In this study, we have used UPb zircon geochronology to provide a time frame for the creation of the schist formation and metamorphism, as well as a new tectonic model. Twenty-three schist and eleven meta-magmatic samples were used for UPb dating by LA-ICP-MS. Results from the youngest peak age of detrital zircon indicate that the schist formed in a new depositional age of 120–110Ma and, therefore, is different from the previously estimated age of the Paleozoic-Mesozoic. Additionally, the block-in-matrix schist indicates an age that ranges from 270 to 80Ma and was inferred from the chaotic deposits to be a metamorphic mélange. The Tananao Schist Belt appears to represent an arc-trench system that formed during the Cretaceous in the South China Block margin. Moreover, the youngest UPb age of 80Ma from the leucogranite dike and schist, constrains the upper age limit for a metamorphism that is younger than the previously accepted age of 100–90Ma. The contact layer between Permian-Triassic marble and the overlying early Cretaceous schists remains a chloritoid bed that is, therefore, considered to be a paleosol at the unconformity, which formed over an extended duration of 60±30Ma. The stratigraphic contact indicates a long period of erosion during the Jurassic and suggests that a tectonic event occurred. However, we propose that two important metamorphic events took place prior to, and following, the schist formation during the Jurassic and late Cretaceous orogenic events.
