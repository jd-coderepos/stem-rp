Variability is an ongoing challenge to growth of large-scale renewable power generation, posing challenges for the power grid and ambitious renewable portfolio standards. The authors propose Zero-Carbon Cloud (ZCCloud), a new high-value, dispatchable demand for renewables that improves their economic viability. Initial studies show that ZCCloud can create high-value computing resources with payback periods of just a few years.
