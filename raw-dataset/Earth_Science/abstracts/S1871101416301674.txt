We refine the tephrostratigraphy and cryptotephrostratigraphy of the Middle Pleistocene deep-sea sediments in the C9001C cores and reconstruct the age model of the cores to provide a standard stratigraphy for the NW Pacific Ocean area. In the lower half of the cores (corresponding to marine isotopic stages [MISs] 9–18), we newly identify nine concentrations (spikes) of glass shards (numbered G17–G25 from top to bottom) below sixteen previously reported spikes (numbered G1–G16) in the upper half of the cores (MISs 1–9). We correlated two spikes (both cryptotephras) with known widespread tephras: G18 with Naruohama-IV (MIS 10d; 357 ka) and G19 with Kasamori 5 (MIS 12b–c; 434–458 ka). Although the two cryptotephra spikes cannot be distinguished by the major- and trace-element compositions of glass shards, these correlations are based upon their stratigraphic occurrence within separate glacial periods (MISs 10 and 12) as indicated by the δ18O stratigraphy of the C9001C sequence. Based on the stratigraphic positions of the Naruohama-IV and Kasamori 5 tephras, we assign the sediment units corresponding to MISs 10, 11, and 12, and revise the previous assignment of core segments corresponding to MISs 7, 8, and 9. The resulting tephra-based age model is consistent with the last occurrence of Proboscia curvirostris, but it is inconsistent with the first occurrence of Emiliania huxleyi. According to the new age model, the sedimentation rate during MISs 18–2 has ranged from 0.21 m/ky (during MIS 17) to 0.74 m/ky (during MISs 8 and 9), however, the sedimentation rate was never as high as the rate of 1.1 m/ky indicated by an earlier age model.
