The management of urban major hazard installations (UMHI) is important for the public safety and the surrounding ecological environment. The safety managers will have great challenges due to the rapid urbanization and industrialization. In this paper, we developed a 3DGIS-based tool for decision support of UMHI management. The methods of UMHI management are respectively established for real-time risk early warning and consequence assessment. These methods are then integrated into the 3DGIS tool. Finally, the tool is applied to a petrochemical enterprise in urban areas to demonstrate its workflow and functions. The tool successfully simulates the virtual environment of accident scenes, evaluate the real-time risk and accident consequences, and vividly display the analysis results in the form of 3D visualization. The application results show that the tool is of high efficiency, real-time and immersive sense, which can provide decision support for disaster prevention, emergency response and safety planning in urban areas.
