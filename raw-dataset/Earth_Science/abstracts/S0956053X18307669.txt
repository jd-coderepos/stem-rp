Biological recycling of polyurethanes (PU) is a huge challenge to take up in order to reduce a large part of the environmental pollution from these materials. However, enzymatic depolymerization of PU still needs to be improved to propose valuable and green solutions. The present study aims to identify efficient PU degrading enzymes among a collection of 50 hydrolases. Screenings based on model molecules were performed leading to the selection of an efficient amidase (E4143) able to hydrolyze the urethane bond of a low molar mass molecule and an esterase (E3576) able to hydrolyze a waterborne polyester polyurethane dispersion. Degradation activities of the amidase, the esterase and a mix of these enzymes were then evaluated on four thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) specifically designed for this assay. The highest degradation was obtained on a polycaprolactone polyol-based polyurethane with weight loss of 33% after 51 days measured for the esterase. Deep cracks on the polymer surface observed by scanning electron microscopy and the presence of oligomers on the remaining TPU detected by size exclusion chromatography evidenced the polymer degradation. Mixing both enzymes led to an increased amount of urethane bonds hydrolysis of the polymer. 6-hydroxycaproic acid and 4,4â€²-methylene dianiline were recovered after depolymerization as hydrolysis products. Such building blocks could get a second life with the synthesis of new macromolecular architectures.
