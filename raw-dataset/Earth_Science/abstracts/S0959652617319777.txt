This paper assesses the environmental profile of the biscuit supply chain for producing high quality gluten-free biscuits. Three different types of biscuits were considered. The assessment followed a cradle-to-grave approach applying the ISO standards in compliance with the Product Category Rules (PCR) defined within EPD (Environmental Product Declaration) for bakery products. Analogous environmental profiles were implemented for assessing the products: It was found that the main hotspot in all impact categories was ingredients production with the range contribution from 22.2% to 84.9%, followed by transportation. Initial hypotheses for ingredients origin and waste management practices were demonstrated to have a key influence on the environmental results: higher packaging recycling rates and local ingredients usage led to improved environmental results (up to 5.5%) while direct food waste disposal was responsible for slightly unfavourable performance relative to base case (below 1%). Additionally, healthier ingredients such as xylitol and fructose were used to evaluate their potential benefits from an environmental perspective. It was found that only the use of fructose was a suitable alternative sweetener for more sustainable production.
