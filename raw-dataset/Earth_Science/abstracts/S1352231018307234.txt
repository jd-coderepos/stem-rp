This study conducted a long-term chloride deposition monitoring at 5 bridges in Da Nang city, Vietnam, by wet candle method with weekly sampling frequency. The monitored records showed prompt changes of chloride deposition in unfavorable weather events such as typhoon, depression. Prior to this long-term monitoring, weekly sampling monitoring was tested by short-term test in Yokohama city. This short-term test showed that the total chloride amount collected by weekly sampling frequency is almost equal to that collected by monthly sampling frequency in a same monitoring period, i.e. it is applicable to conduct aerosol chloride deposition monitoring with weekly sampling frequency. Besides, a new effect analysis of wind on chloride deposition using effective wind power was proposed and applied for long-term monitored data and meteorological data in this study. This new analysis succeeded in constructing the relation function of wind parameters including wind speed and wind direction with chloride deposition with better variance compared to conventional analysis method.
