We examined a 60-year record of daily precipitation and river discharge related to tropical cyclones (TCs) in four watersheds undergoing land use and land cover change near Houston, Texas. Results show that TCs are responsible for âˆ¼20% of the annual maximum discharge events in the four selected watersheds. Although there are no trends in TC precipitation, increasing trends were observed in daily extreme discharge and TC-related discharge. The more developed watersheds (Whiteoak Bayou and Brays Bayou), tend to have higher extreme discharge and steeper trends in extreme discharge than the less developed watersheds (Cypress Creek). Increases in TC-related extreme discharges correspond with increases in developed land and decreases in vegetated land between 1980 and 2006. Therefore, changes in land cover/use in watersheds near Houston are a major cause of the increased flooding risk in recent years.
