A new work-flow is proposed to unify the way the community shares Logistic Regression results for landslide susceptibility purposes. Although Logistic Regression models and methods have been widely used in geomorphology for several decades, no standards for presenting results in a consistent way have been adopted; most papers report parameters with different units and interpretations, therefore limiting potential meta-analytic applications. We first summarize the major differences in the geomorphological literature and then investigate each one proposing current best practices and few methodological developments. The latter is mainly represented by a widely used approach in statistics for simultaneous parameter estimation and variable selection in generalized linear models, namely the Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator (LASSO). The North-easternmost sector of Sicily (Italy) is chosen as a straightforward example with well exposed debris flows induced by extreme rainfall.
