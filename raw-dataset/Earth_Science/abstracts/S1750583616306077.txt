The regeneration heat for a polyethyleneimine (PEI)/silica adsorbent based carbon capture system is first assessed in order to evaluate its effect on the efficiency penalty of a coal or natural gas power plant. Process simulations are then carried out on the net plant efficiencies for a specific supercritical 550MWe pulverized coal (PC) and a 555MWe natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plant integrated with a conceptually designed capture system using fluidized beds and PEI/silica adsorbent. A benchmark system applying an advanced MEA absorption technology in a NETL report (2010) is used as a reference system. Using the conservatively estimated parameters, the net plant efficiency of the PC and NGCC power plant with the proposed capture system is found to be 1.5% and 0.6% point higher than the reference PC and NGCC systems, respectively. Sensitivity analysis has revealed that the moisture adsorption, working capacity and heat recovery strategies are the most influential parameters to the power plant efficiency. Under an optimal scenario with improvements in increasing the working capacity by 2% points and decreasing moisture adsorption by 1% point, the plant efficiencies with the proposed capture system are 2.7% (PC) and 1.9% (NGCC) points higher than the reference systems.
