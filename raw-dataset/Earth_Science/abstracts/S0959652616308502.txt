To enable the consideration of life cycle environmental impacts in the early stages of vehicle design, a methodology using the proxy of life cycle energy is proposed in this paper. The trade-offs in energy between vehicle production, operational performance and end-of-life are formulated as a mathematical problem, and simultaneously balanced with other transport-related functionalities, and may be optimised. The methodology is illustrated through an example design study, which is deliberately kept simple in order to emphasise the conceptual idea. The obtained optimisation results demonstrate that there is a unique driving-scenario-specific design solution, which meets functional requirements with a minimum life cycle energy cost. The results also suggest that a use-phase focussed design may result in a solution, which is sub-optimal from a life cycle point-of-view.
