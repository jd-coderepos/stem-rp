The most common mass spectrometry approach analyzing contamination of the environment deals with targeted analysis, i.e. detection and quantification of the selected (priority) pollutants. However non-targeted analysis is becoming more often the method of choice for environmental chemists. It involves implementation of modern analytical instrumentation allowing for comprehensive detection and identification of the wide variety of compounds of the environmental interest present in the sample, such as pharmaceuticals and their metabolites, musks, nanomaterials, perfluorinated compounds, hormones, disinfection by-products, flame retardants, personal care products, and many others emerging contaminants. The paper presents the results of detection and identification of previously unreported organic compounds in snow samples collected in Moscow in March 2016. The snow analysis allows evaluation of long-term air pollution in the winter period. Gas chromatography coupled to a high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer has enabled us with capability to detect and identify such novel analytes as iodinated compounds, polychlorinated anisoles and even Ni-containing organic complex, which are unexpected in environmental samples. Some considerations concerning the possible sources of origin of these compounds in the environment are discussed.
