Phytoremediation is one of the methods for Bioremediation of the soils which has been noticed in recent decades. Two years sapling of Mulberry nigra selected and Mercury(II) nitrate solution with 30, 50 and 70 mg/L concentrations, after add solutions in to soil of sapling Mulberry nigra, eight months’ later leaf, stem and roots were selected and Measuring mercury was determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrometer. The maximum level of mercury accumulation in the leaf, stem and root was 55.67, 50 and 65 mg/kg, respectively. Mercury could be absorbed easily by the plant’s root and accumulated in the plants.
