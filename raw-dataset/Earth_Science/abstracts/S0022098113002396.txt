In the literature, it is commonly stated that Uca spp. (fiddler crab) burrows aerate marsh sediment. However, to date few studies have attempted to determine the pore water oxygen (O2) concentrations associated with Uca spp. burrows; instead most studies have looked at redox potential, a measure of oxidation and not of O2. In an in situ study conducted in salt marshes on the Atlantic coast of Virginia, USA, O2 concentrations surrounding individual burrows were measured to assess the potential of burrows to aerate bulk sediment. Using an O2 microelectrode, concentration profiles were measured at depth intervals of 500Î¼m to a depth of 10mm. The O2 profiles were measured at distances of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10mm from the burrow wall. Measurements were made surrounding natural and artificial burrows as well as where burrows were absent as a control. Contrary to convictions in the literature, this study determined that, within poorly drained muddy sediments, oxygen penetration depth only had a significant increase out to a distance of 2mm from the burrow wall, and the increase in oxygen depth penetration was only 0.5mm compared to areas not affected by the presence of the burrow. In typical muddy sediments of salt marshes along the mid-Atlantic coast, USA, the presence of Uca pugnax burrows increased the oxic zone little, but may have had an effect on the extent of the suboxic zone. Therefore, generalizations should not be made concerning the ability of burrows to aerate surrounding bulk sediments. In addition, the capacity of sediments to drain is an important factor in determining the potential for increased sediment aeration due to the presence of Uca spp. burrows.
