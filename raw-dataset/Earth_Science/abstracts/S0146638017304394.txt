The distribution of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in soils, peats, and lake sediments has been shown to correlate with mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and has provided valuable new climate reconstructions. Here we use an improved chromatographic method to quantify the fractional abundances of 5- and 6-methyl isomers in surface sediments from 65 East African lakes spanning temperatures 1.6–26.8 °C, and investigate the relationships between these fractional abundances and temperature, lake pH, and other environmental variables. We find that temperature exerts a strong control on brGDGT distributions, including the relative abundances of 5- and 6-methyl isomers, whereas other environmental variables, including lake pH, are weakly correlated to the fractional abundances of the brGDGTs. The distributions of brGDGTs in our lake sediments differ from those of soils and peats, leading to temperature offsets if soil- and peat-based brGDGT temperature calibrations are applied. We develop new calibrations for MAAT for use in lake sediment based upon the MBT′5Me and Index 1 ratios, as well as a multivariate regression of brGDGT fractional abundances on temperature using stepwise forward selection. We obtain root mean square errors (RMSE) between ∼ 2.1 and 2.5 °C for these calibrations, highlighting the potential for brGDGTs to provide precise temperature reconstructions using lake sediment cores. Calibrations for lake pH perform more poorly, likely due to weak correlations between pH and brGDGT distributions in East African lakes. These results indicate that quantification of 5- and 6-methyl isomers separately in lake sediment can improve paleoclimatic reconstructions.
