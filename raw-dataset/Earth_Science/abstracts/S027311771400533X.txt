The diurnal variations in total electron content (TEC) in the equatorial ionisation anomaly (EIA) region are not always represented by two crests on both sides of the magnetic equator. Sometimes, only an obvious single crest is evident at equatorial and low latitudes. In this paper, we focus on analysis of the morphological features of the single crest phenomenon in TEC around 120°E longitude during geomagnetic quiet days (Kp<4−). The variations in TEC are also compared with morphological parameters (foF2 and hmF2) derived from the International Reference Ionosphere extended to Plasmasphere (IRI–Plas) model. Our results show that the single crest phenomenon occurs mainly on days with extremely low solar activity, while the corresponding F2 layer critical frequency showed obvious asymmetry, or even only a single peak.
